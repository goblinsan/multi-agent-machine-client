# Quick Reference: Critical Fixes

## Issue Summary
Fixed 5 critical issues preventing distributed multi-agent coordination:
1. ✅ Local machine paths being sent to remote agents
2. ✅ Planning evaluation loop not exiting on Pass
3. ✅ DiffApply steps not finding implementation diffs
4. ✅ Dashboard milestone data not propagating
5. ✅ Error handling verified

## Key Changes

### 1. Remote URL Enforcement
**Before:** Steps received local paths like `/Users/user/code/repo`
**After:** Steps receive only remote URLs like `git@github.com:user/repo.git`

**Impact:** Each agent resolves remote to their local PROJECT_BASE

### 2. Planning Loop Fix
**Before:** Loop checked wrong status field, continued after Pass
**After:** Loop uses `interpretPersonaStatus()` to check actual evaluation result

**Impact:** Loop exits immediately on Pass or at max iterations

### 3. Diff Application Fix
**Before:** WorkflowEngine stored wrong output field
**After:** Engine prioritizes `result.outputs` over `result.data`

**Impact:** DiffApply finds implementation diffs and applies changes

### 4. Dashboard Data Fix
**Before:** Only milestone name passed
**After:** Full milestone object + individual fields passed

**Impact:** All workflow steps have complete project context

### 5. Error Handling Verified
**Status:** Already working correctly
**Behavior:** Workflows terminate immediately on critical errors

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Remote agents can access repos via remote URL
- [ ] Planning loop exits on first Pass evaluation
- [ ] Implementation diffs are applied to files
- [ ] Milestone info appears in persona payloads
- [ ] Critical errors stop workflow execution

## Deployment Steps

1. Pull latest changes
2. Verify PROJECT_BASE is set on all machines
3. Ensure dashboard projects have repository URLs
4. Test with a simple task first
5. Monitor logs for any remote URL resolution issues

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required on all machines
PROJECT_BASE=/path/to/repos

# Optional
MC_ALLOW_WORKSPACE_GIT=1  # Allow workspace repo mutations
```

## Common Issues

### "No repository remote URL available"
- **Cause:** Project missing repository URL in dashboard
- **Fix:** Set repository URL in project settings

### "Cannot access repo path"
- **Cause:** Agent trying to use coordinator's local path
- **Fix:** Ensure changes are deployed (PersonaRequestStep updated)

### "No diff content found"
- **Cause:** Lead-engineer response format changed
- **Fix:** Check DiffApplyStep logs for field names, update getDiffContent()

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to previous commit
2. Ensure remote URLs are configured
3. Check PROJECT_BASE on all machines
4. Review persona response formats
