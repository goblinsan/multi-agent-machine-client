Happy Path Test Status
======================

## Current Issue
The Happy Path test is timing out because `PersonaRequestStep.execute()` calls `makeRedis()` and tries to call `redis.disconnect()`, but the Redis connection is undefined despite our mock.

## Analysis
1. **Persona Mock Works**: `sendPersonaRequest` and `waitForPersonaCompletion` are successfully mocked and return expected values
2. **Redis Mock Fails**: `makeRedis()` mock returns undefined instead of the mocked Redis object
3. **Context Call Counting**: Successfully changed from counting `2-plan` calls to counting `1-context` calls as task entrypoint metric
4. **Workflow Execution**: New workflow structure is executing correctly through multiple iterations (reached iteration 10)

## Root Cause
The `PersonaRequestStep` creates its own Redis connection and tries to disconnect it after each persona request, but the Redis mock isn't working properly, causing `redis.disconnect()` to fail with "Cannot read properties of undefined".

## Solution Options
1. **Fix Redis Mock**: Debug why `vi.mock('../src/redisClient.js')` isn't working properly
2. **Mock PersonaRequestStep**: Create a mock that skips Redis operations entirely for tests
3. **Conditional Redis**: Modify PersonaRequestStep to detect test environment and skip Redis operations

## Progress
- ✅ Fixed workflow step counting logic (context calls vs plan calls)  
- ✅ Added Redis client mock with all required methods
- ✅ Disabled compatibility layer that was causing Redis issues
- ❌ Redis mock still not working in PersonaRequestStep

## Next Steps
Try Option 2: Mock the PersonaRequestStep to completely bypass Redis operations during tests while preserving the persona request/response logic.
