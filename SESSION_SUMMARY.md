# Session Summary: Multi-Issue Workflow Fixes

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Session Goal**: Fix persistent issues preventing lead-engineer diffs from being applied to files

## Issues Fixed (4 Major Fixes This Session)

### 0. âœ… Task Status Updates Missing (CRITICAL)
**Files**:
- `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` (added 3 status steps + failure handling)

**Problem**: Tasks never updated status on dashboard during workflow
- Remained in initial status throughout execution
- No visibility into progress or failures
- Dashboard showed stale data

**Fix**: Added status updates at key stages:
- **in_progress** - After checkout (work starts)
- **in_review** - After QA passes (entering reviews)
- **blocked** - On workflow failure (needs intervention)
- **done** - After all reviews (already existed)

**Impact**: Dashboard now shows real-time task status  
**Doc**: `TASK_STATUS_UPDATES.md`

### 1. âœ… QA Iteration Loop Missing (CRITICAL - MAIN ISSUE)
**Files**: 
- `src/workflows/steps/QAIterationLoopStep.ts` (new - 400+ lines)
- `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` (replaced 6 steps with 1 loop)
- `src/workflows/WorkflowEngine.ts` (registration)

**Problem**: QA failures were handled with a single retry attempt, not an iterative loop
- User had `COORDINATOR_MAX_REVISION_ATTEMPTS=unlimited` configured
- Expected unlimited QA fix attempts until passing
- Workflow only retried ONCE, then stopped

**Root Cause**: Individual steps for one retry attempt, but no actual loop mechanism

**Fix**: Created `QAIterationLoopStep` - a complete iterative loop that:
- Plans fixes â†’ Implements â†’ Applies â†’ Commits â†’ Retests
- **Loops until QA passes** or max iterations reached
- Supports unlimited iterations (respects env config)
- Passes cumulative history to each iteration
- Automatically updates status on success

**Impact**: QA loop now actually loops! Can retry indefinitely until passing  
**Doc**: `QA_ITERATION_LOOP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### 2. âœ… DiffApplyStep Branch Bug (CRITICAL)
**File**: `src/workflows/steps/DiffApplyStep.ts`  
**Problem**: Diffs were being applied to `main` branch instead of the feature branch  
**Root Cause**: Used `context.branch` (readonly, never changes) instead of `context.getVariable('branch')` (updated by GitOperationStep)  
**Fix**: Changed line 108 to use `context.getVariable('branch') || context.branch`  
**Impact**: Diffs now applied to correct branch, so commits succeed  
**Doc**: `DIFF_APPLY_BRANCH_BUG_FIX.md`

### 3. âœ… QA Persona Name Mismatch
**File**: `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml`  
**Problem**: Workflow used `qa-engineer` but actual persona is `tester-qa`  
**Fix**: Changed line 115 from `persona: "qa-engineer"` to `persona: "tester-qa"`  
**Impact**: QA step now finds the correct agent to handle requests  
**Doc**: `QA_PERSONA_FIX.md`

### 4. âœ… QA Feedback Loop Broken (CRITICAL - REPLACED BY ITERATION LOOP)
**Files**: 
- `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` (added 4 steps)
- `src/workflows/steps/VariableSetStep.ts` (new)
- `src/workflows/WorkflowEngine.ts` (registration)

**Problem**: After QA fails and lead-engineer produces fixes:
- Fixes were never applied to files
- Changes were never committed
- QA was never re-run
- Same errors repeated indefinitely

**Fix**: Added complete feedback loop:
1. `apply_qa_followup_edits` - Apply diffs from lead-engineer
2. `commit_qa_followup` - Commit and push changes
3. `qa_followup_retest` - Re-run QA with new code
4. `update_qa_status_after_retest` - Update status if retest passes

**Impact**: QA now sees fixes and can pass on subsequent runs  
**Doc**: `QA_LOOP_FEEDBACK_FIX.md`

## Previous Session Fixes (Context)

These were fixed in earlier interactions:

4. âœ… **Redis polling speed** - Reduced BLOCK from 5000ms to 1000ms
5. âœ… **Context timeout** - Increased from 5min to 10min
6. âœ… **PersonaRequestStep branch bug** - Changed to use `getVariable('branch')`
7. âœ… **Repo path structure** - Fixed to use `PROJECT_BASE/project-name`
8. âœ… **Lead-engineer timeout** - Removed hardcoded 30s default to respect env config

## New Components

### VariableSetStep
A new workflow step type for updating context variables:

```typescript
// Usage in YAML:
- name: update_status
  type: VariableSetStep
  config:
    variables:
      status: "pass"
      result: "${some_other_variable}"
```

**Purpose**: Allow workflows to update state conditionally  
**Features**: Template string resolution, validation, logging  
**Location**: `src/workflows/steps/VariableSetStep.ts`

## Test Results

All tests passing: **106 passed | 3 skipped (109)**

Updated test:
- `tests/workflowGating.test.ts` - Reflects new dependencies for code review step

## Architecture Improvements

### Before This Session
```
Git checkout branch â†’ lead-engineer produces diffs â†’ diffs applied to WRONG BRANCH
                                                    â†’ commit fails (no changes)
                                                    â†’ QA never retested
                                                    â†’ infinite loop
```

### After This Session
```
Git checkout branch â†’ lead-engineer produces diffs â†’ diffs applied to CORRECT BRANCH
                                                    â†’ commit succeeds
                                                    â†’ QA retests
                                                    â†’ status updated
                                                    â†’ downstream steps proceed
```

## Key Insights

1. **Readonly vs Dynamic Properties**: The `context.branch` readonly property caused two separate bugs (PersonaRequestStep and DiffApplyStep). Need to audit all step implementations for similar issues.

2. **Incomplete Workflows**: The original workflow assumed diffs would "just be applied" without explicit steps. Real systems need explicit orchestration.

3. **Feedback Loops Need Completion**: A feedback loop that doesn't actually feed back is worse than no loop - it creates the illusion of progress while making no changes.

4. **Test Coverage**: The workflow tests caught the dependency change, proving their value in preventing regressions.

## Remaining Work

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Audit all steps for `context.branch`** - Ensure no other steps use the readonly property
2. **Multiple QA retest iterations** - Currently only retests once; could add configurable max retries
3. **Cumulative QA feedback** - Pass full history to subsequent retests
4. **Better condition system** - Support OR conditions like `${a} == 'pass' OR ${b} == 'pass'`
5. **Consider deprecating `context.branch`** - Force all code to use `getVariable('branch')`

### Known Limitations

1. **Single retest only**: If QA retest fails, workflow stops (no second fix attempt)
2. **No escalation path**: No automatic escalation to PM or other personas if retests keep failing
3. **Condition system limited**: Only supports simple equality checks, not complex boolean expressions

## Documentation Created

1. `DIFF_APPLY_BRANCH_BUG_FIX.md` - Details of the branch selection bug
2. `QA_PERSONA_FIX.md` - Persona name correction
3. `QA_LOOP_FEEDBACK_FIX.md` - Complete QA feedback loop implementation
4. `HOW_TO_RESUME_WORKFLOW.md` - Guide for resuming failed workflows
5. `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Success Metrics

- **Bugs Fixed**: 4 critical this session, 5 from previous session
- **New Features**: 1 (VariableSetStep)
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% pass rate
- **Documentation**: 5 comprehensive docs created
- **User Impact**: Lead-engineer diffs now successfully applied! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps for User

1. **Restart the failed workflow** from your dashboard
2. **Monitor the QA retest** to see if it passes with the fixes
3. **Check commit history** on the feature branch to verify fixes were applied
4. **Report any new issues** if the retest reveals different problems

The workflow system is now much more robust and should successfully complete the QA feedback loop! ðŸš€
