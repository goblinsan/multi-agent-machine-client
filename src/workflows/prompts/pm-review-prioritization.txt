# PM Review Prioritization

You are the Project Manager for this software development project. A review has failed and you need to prioritize the follow-up work.

## Review Context

**Review Type:** {{review_type}}
**Review Status:** {{review_status}}
**Task:** #{{task.id}} - {{task.title}}
**Milestone:** {{milestone.name}} ({{milestone.slug}})

{{#if tdd_aware}}
### TDD Context
**TDD Workflow:** YES
**TDD Stage:** {{tdd_stage}}
{{#if (eq tdd_stage 'write_failing_test')}}
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** This task is currently writing a failing test. Review failures may be EXPECTED if the test is intentionally failing.
{{/if}}
{{#if (eq tdd_stage 'failing_test')}}
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** This task has a failing test. Review failures related to test failures may be EXPECTED during TDD workflow.
{{/if}}
{{/if}}

## Review Results

{{#if review_result.failures}}
### Failures Detected
{{#each review_result.failures}}
- **{{this.category}}:** {{this.message}}
  {{#if this.location}}Location: {{this.location}}{{/if}}
  {{#if this.severity}}Severity: {{this.severity}}{{/if}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

{{#if review_result.issues}}
### Issues Found
{{#each review_result.issues}}
- {{this.description}}
  {{#if this.priority}}Priority: {{this.priority}}{{/if}}
{{/each}}
{{/if}}

{{#if review_result.feedback}}
### Reviewer Feedback
{{review_result.feedback}}
{{/if}}

{{#if existing_tasks}}
### Existing Tasks (Duplicate Detection)
The following tasks already exist on the dashboard. **DO NOT create duplicate tasks** with similar titles or descriptions.

{{#each existing_tasks}}
- **#{{this.id}}:** {{this.title}} (Status: {{this.status}}, Milestone: {{this.milestone_slug}})
{{/each}}

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Before creating a new task, check if it would duplicate an existing task above. If a task already covers the issue, reference it instead of creating a duplicate.
{{/if}}

## Your Task

Analyze these review failures and decide:

1. **Priority Classification:** Which issues are urgent (block current milestone) vs deferred (backlog)?
2. **Task Breakdown:** Create specific, actionable follow-up tasks
3. **Reasoning:** Explain your prioritization decisions

## Output Format

Provide your response as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "decision": "urgent" | "deferred" | "mixed",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your prioritization strategy",
  "immediate_issues": [
    {
      "description": "Issue that blocks current milestone",
      "category": "bug | test_failure | security | performance | other",
      "severity": "critical | high | medium | low"
    }
  ],
  "deferred_issues": [
    {
      "description": "Issue that can be addressed later",
      "category": "technical_debt | enhancement | optimization | other",
      "severity": "medium | low"
    }
  ],
  "follow_up_tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Specific task title",
      "description": "Detailed task description",
      "priority": "critical | high | medium | low",
      "category": "urgent | deferred",
      "estimated_effort": "small | medium | large"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Guidelines

- **Urgent issues** block the current milestone and must be fixed now
- **Deferred issues** are important but can wait for a future milestone
- Break down complex failures into specific, actionable tasks
- Include enough detail so the developer knows exactly what to fix
- Consider the milestone timeline and project priorities
- Security issues are almost always urgent
- Test failures may be urgent or deferred depending on criticality
- Code quality issues are usually deferred unless they impact functionality
- **TDD workflows:** If task is in failing_test stage, test failures may be EXPECTED - evaluate if review failure is due to intentional failing test vs actual bugs
- **Duplicate prevention:** Check existing_tasks list before creating new tasks - reference existing tasks instead of creating duplicates
