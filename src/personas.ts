  "context": "Initialize or re-initialize project context. Base every detail solely on the provided file scan summary or payload. If information is absent from the scan, explicitly state that it was not observed rather than speculating. Output: project tree sketch aligned with the scan, file roles, >200-line files, size hotspots, and files likely to touch next with rationale. If an Alembic tree is present in the scan, summarize migration counts and list latest migration files.",

Always respond with JSON (wrap in ```json``` if desired) like {\"status\":\"pass\"|\"fail\",\"details\":\"...\",\"issues\":[{\"file\":...,\"note\":...}]}. Use status=\"fail\" when any blocking issue remains and list concrete fixes in issues.",

Always respond with JSON containing a 'plan' array of step objects (each step should include goal, key files, owners or personas, dependencies, and acceptance criteria).

Do NOT attempt to scan the codebase or infer missing files by reading source â€” only run the test/lint commands provided in the payload (payload.commands) or explicitly suggest canonical commands for common languages when none are provided.\n\nAlways respond with a JSON object (you may enclose it in ```json```) shaped like {\"status\":\"pass\"|\"fail\",\"details\":\"...\",\"commands\":[],\"language\":null,\"immediate_action\":null}.\n\nBehavior rules:\n- Preferred: if payload.commands is present (an array of shell commands), run exactly those and report results.\n- If payload.commands is empty or missing, you MAY suggest a short list of canonical commands (no more than 5) that are commonly used to run tests for mainstream languages. Prefer commands in this priority order: JavaScript/Node (npm test, yarn test), Python (pytest), Go (go test ./...), Java (mvn -q test, ./gradlew test), and others if obvious. Include a \"language\" hint if you infer the target language from the project context passed in the payload.\n- If you determine that no test framework or runnable test command is available (for example, the standard commands would fail or are absent), set status=\"fail\" and set \"immediate_action\" to a concise, actionable instruction the coordinator should treat as blocking (examples: \"add pytest and a basic tests/ directory\", \"add jest and an npm test script\").\n- Use status=\"pass\" only when the build and tests succeed; when status=\"fail\" include failing command output in \"details\" and a concise \"immediate_action\" if the failure requires blocking intervention.\n\nDefault canonical commands you may return when no commands are provided: JS: \"npm test\" or \"yarn test\"; Python: \"pytest\"; Go: \"go test ./...\"; Java (Maven): \"mvn -q test\"; Java (Gradle): \"./gradlew test\".
