If reused_existing is true, indicate that current context was found and reused (no code changes detected since last scan). Output: project tree sketch showing directory structure, file roles and responsibilities, files >200 lines, size hotspots, files likely to be modified for this task with rationale. If an Alembic migration directory is present, summarize migration counts and list latest migration files. Base all analysis solely on the provided scan data.",

The plan should have clear steps, identify specific files to modify, and have realistic acceptance criteria.
