## Phase 0: Workflow Rationalization (PREREQUISITE)
**Timeline:** Week 1 (Oct 19 - Oct 25, 2025)  
**Goal:** Analyze and rationalize YAML workflows, establish reusable patterns

### Background
The current workflows directory contains multiple workflow files, some of which are unused or legacy. The main driver is `legacy-compatible-task-flow`, but the workflow structure needs rationalization to:
1. Identify which workflows are actually in use
2. Decompose workflows into reusable sub-workflow patterns
3. Ensure consistency across workflow implementations
4. Remove/archive unused workflows

### Tasks

- [x] **Day 1: Workflow Inventory & Analysis**
  - [x] List all workflow files in `workflows/` directory
  - [x] Identify which workflows are actively used in production
  - [x] Document `legacy-compatible-task-flow` structure and usage
  - [x] Map workflow dependencies and relationships
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete (Oct 19, 2025)
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.md` ✅
  
  **Key Findings:**
  - 12 workflow files total (3 in `/workflows`, 9 in `/src/workflows/definitions`)
  - `legacy-compatible-task-flow` (446 lines) is primary driver (95%+ usage)
  - Only 3-4 workflows actively used, rest are unused/duplicates
  - **3 different implementations** for review failure handling (QA, code, security)
  - Dashboard task creation is N+1 problem (needs bulk endpoint)
  - Workflow too complex (30 steps, needs decomposition)

- [x] **Day 2: Pattern Extraction**
  - [x] Identify common patterns across workflows
  - [x] Document dashboard interaction patterns (task creation, updates, queries)
  - [x] Identify review patterns (QA, Code Review, Security)
  - [x] Identify coordination patterns (PM evaluation, TDD gates)
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete (Oct 19, 2025)
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_PATTERNS.md` ✅
  
  **Key Findings:**
  - **7 major patterns identified:** Git ops, task status, review execution, review failure handling, planning/implementation, iteration loops, milestone ops
  - **Review failure handling has 3 implementations:** QAFailureCoordinationStep (embedded PM), ReviewFailureTasksStep (separate PM), copy-paste for security
  - **530 lines of duplication** in review failure handling (can reduce to 50 lines)
  - **Dashboard N+1 problem confirmed:** Sequential task creation needs bulk endpoint
  - **6 dashboard operations documented:** Status updates, task creation, milestone queries, etc.
  - **PM prompts embedded in YAML:** 450+ lines total, should be externalized

- [x] **Day 3: Sub-Workflow Design** ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 19, 2025)

  - [x] Define sub-workflow interfaces (inputs/outputs)
  - [x] Map how sub-workflows compose into full workflows
  - [x] Identify opportunities for standardization
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/SUB_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md` ✅
  - **Key Findings:**
    - **3 sub-workflows designed:** review-failure-handling (Priority 1), task-implementation (Priority 2), git-operations (Priority 3)
    - **530 → 60 lines reduction** for review failures (89% reduction)
    - **446 → 200 lines reduction** for main workflow (55% reduction)
    - **Total: 976 → 260 lines** (73% reduction)
    - **Bulk task creation strategy** defined (fixes N+1 problem)
    - **PM prompt externalization** (450+ lines → single template)

- Phase 6 (Week 9): Stage detection + iteration limits + tests (~500 lines)
- **Total:** ~1,365 lines added, ~20 removed (net +1,345)

### Week 4-5: Test Groups 1-4

#### Test Group 1: Review Trigger Logic ✅ APPROVED
**Files Analyzed:**
- `tests/qaFailureCoordination.test.ts` (177 lines)
- `tests/reviewFlowValidation.test.ts` (178 lines)
- `tests/tddGovernanceGate.test.ts` (45 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete + User Approved (Oct 19, 2025)  
**Deliverable:** `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_1_REVIEW_TRIGGERS.md` (635 lines) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All 4 workflows use identical review trigger pattern: `fail || unknown`
- ✅ Sequential review flow: QA → Code → Security → DevOps → Done
- ⚠️ TDD governance: Reviews should be context-aware (needs verification)
- ❌ **BUG FOUND:** DevOps failures don't block task completion or trigger PM eval
- ✅ 5 test scenarios extracted (triggers, dependencies, TDD, cycles, QA loop)
- ✅ 7 questions answered by user
- ✅ 3 recommendations approved

**USER CHECKPOINT #3: Review Trigger Logic Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**User Decisions:**
1. ✅ `unknown` status triggers PM eval (same as `fail`) - CONFIRMED
2. ⚠️ TDD: Reviews should understand task goal might be failing test (verify implementation)
3. ❌ DevOps failures SHOULD trigger PM eval (BUG - not currently implemented)
4. ✅ Only 3 statuses (pass/fail/unknown), anything not "pass" → PM eval
5. ✅ No security-sensitive task metadata needed
6. ✅ All reviews trigger PM eval, PM handles severity/duplication
7. ⚠️ Make `tdd_aware` default, investigate `workflow_mode` purpose

**Action Items (High Priority):**
- ❌ Fix DevOps review failure handling (add `pm_prioritize_devops_failures` step)
- ⚠️ Verify TDD context passed to review prompts
- ⚠️ Test reviewers don't fail tasks with intentional failing tests

**Approval:** ✅ APPROVED

#### Test Group 2: PM Decision Parsing ✅ COMPLETE
**Files Analyzed:**
- `tests/productionCodeReviewFailure.test.ts` (154 lines)
- `tests/initialPlanningAckAndEval.test.ts` (100 lines)
- `tests/qaPmGating.test.ts` (100 lines)
- `src/workflows/steps/PMDecisionParserStep.ts` (347 lines)
- `src/workflows/steps/ReviewFailureTasksStep.ts` (540 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete (Oct 19, 2025)  
**Deliverable:** `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_2_PM_DECISION_PARSING.md` (635 lines) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ❌ **Production Bug (Architectural):** PM returned both `backlog` and `follow_up_tasks`, 0 tasks created
- ⚠️ **Two Parsing Implementations:** PMDecisionParserStep (modern) vs ReviewFailureTasksStep.parsePMDecision (legacy)
- ✅ **7 PM Response Formats Discovered:** JSON, text, nested wrappers, markdown, status vs decision
- ✅ **Task Routing Strategy:** critical/high → same milestone, medium/low → backlog milestone
- ✅ **17 Validation Questions Generated** (Q2, Q5, Q16-17 are critical)

**USER CHECKPOINT #4: PM Decision Parsing Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ USER DECISION CONFIRMED

**User Decisions:**
1. ✅ **Consolidate to single parser:** Use PMDecisionParserStep only, remove ReviewFailureTasksStep.parsePMDecision
2. ✅ **Follow-up task routing:** critical/high → same milestone (immediate), medium/low → backlog (deferred)
3. ✅ **Production bug is architectural:** Will be fixed by consolidation (no separate bug fix needed)
4. ✅ **Backlog field deprecated:** Update PM prompts to use `follow_up_tasks` only
5. ✅ **Backward compatibility:** If PM returns both fields, merge arrays with warning

**Action Items (Phase 4):**
- Remove ReviewFailureTasksStep.parsePMDecision() method
- Add backlog deprecation handling to PMDecisionParserStep
- Update PM prompts to only use follow_up_tasks
- Update ReviewFailureTasksStep to use PMDecisionParserStep output from context

**Approval:** ✅ APPROVED - Proceed to Test Group 3

#### Test Group 3: Task Creation Logic ✅ APPROVED
**Files Analyzed:**
- `tests/qaFailureTaskCreation.integration.test.ts` (442 lines)
- `tests/codeReviewFailureTaskCreation.integration.test.ts` (520 lines)
- `tests/taskPriorityAndRouting.test.ts` (687 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Complete + User Approved (Oct 19, 2025)  
**Deliverables:**
- `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_3_TASK_CREATION_LOGIC.md` (analysis) ✅
- `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_3_USER_DECISIONS.md` (decisions) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Three Priority Tiers:** QA urgent (1200), Code/Security/DevOps urgent (1000), All deferred (50)
- ✅ **Routing Strategy:** critical/high → same milestone, medium/low → backlog milestone
- ✅ **Title Formatting:** 🚨 [Review Type] (urgent) or 📋 [Review Type] (deferred)
- ✅ **Duplicate Detection:** Title match + 50% description overlap → skip creation
- ✅ **Parent Linking:** All follow-up tasks link to original parent task

**USER CHECKPOINT #5: Task Creation Logic Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**User Decisions:**
1. **Q1 (Priority):** ✅ Keep QA higher at 1200 (test failures block all work)
2. **Q4 (Milestone):** ✅ Yes, urgent tasks always link to parent milestone (block deployment)
3. **Q11 (Assignee):** ✅ Always use implementation-planner (must precede engineering)
4. **Q14 (Duplicate):** ✅ 50% overlap is fair starting point
5. **Q17 (Failure):** ✅ Use backoff-retry (3 attempts), abort workflow on partial failure after retry exhaustion
6. **Q19 (Idempotency):** ✅ RECOMMENDED: Use external_id to prevent duplicates on workflow re-runs

**Implementation Plan (Phase 4-5):**
- Keep priority scores: QA=1200, Code/Security/DevOps=1000, deferred=50
- Add edge case handling for missing parent milestone
- Simplify assignee logic to always use implementation-planner
- Add exponential backoff retry (1s/2s/4s, 3 attempts max)
- Add workflow abort on partial failure after retry exhaustion
- Add external_id generation for idempotency (format: `${workflow_run_id}:${step_id}:${task_index}`)
- Add dashboard schema migration for external_id column
- Update dashboard API to check external_id before creating tasks

**Code Changes:** ~165 lines added, ~20 lines removed (net +145 lines)

**Approval:** ✅ APPROVED - Proceed to Test Group 4

#### Test Group 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases ✅ COMPLETE
**Files Analyzed:**
- `tests/qaFailure.test.ts` (80 lines)
- `tests/blockedTaskResolution.test.ts` (299 lines)
- `tests/repoResolutionFallback.test.ts` (72 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete (Oct 19, 2025)  
**Deliverable:** `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_4_ERROR_HANDLING.md` (451 lines analyzed) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Progressive Timeout:** Each retry gets +30s more timeout (e.g., 90s → 120s → 150s)
- ⚠️ **No Delays Between Retries:** Retries happen immediately (unlike Test Group 3's exponential backoff)
- ✅ **Persona-Specific Timeouts:** context (60s), lead-engineer (90s), qa-engineer (120s)
- ✅ **Persona-Specific Max Retries:** context (3), lead-engineer (5), qa-engineer (unlimited)
- ⚠️ **Blocked Task Attempt Tracking:** Increments counter, but no explicit max limit or escalation
- ✅ **Repository Resolution Fallback:** Local → HTTPS clone → repository field → fail

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **Inconsistent Retry Strategy:** Persona requests use immediate retries (no delays), task creation uses exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s)
- ❌ **Unlimited QA Retries:** QA persona has no max retry limit (potential infinite loop)
- ❌ **No Escalation Path:** No code path for "what happens after max unblock attempts"
- ❌ **No Error Type Detection:** All errors retry (no distinction between transient vs permanent)
- ❌ **No Path Traversal Validation:** repoDirectoryFor() doesn't validate PROJECT_BASE containment

**USER CHECKPOINT #6: Error Handling Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING USER APPROVAL

**Critical Validation Questions (6 of 15):**
1. **Q1 (Retry Strategy):** Should persona requests use exponential backoff (align with task creation), or keep immediate retries?
2. **Q3 (QA Max Retries):** Should QA have a max retry limit (e.g., 10 attempts), or keep unlimited?
3. **Q4 (Unblock Limit):** What should the max unblock attempts be? Should it be configurable?
4. **Q5 (Escalation):** What should happen when unblock attempts are exhausted? (mark blocked, create task, notify, abort)
5. **Q10 (Workflow Abort):** Should workflow abort on persona retry exhaustion (like task creation partial failure)?
6. **Q11 (Error Types):** Should we distinguish transient vs permanent failures (e.g., 503 retry, 404 don't retry)?

**Additional Questions (9 remaining):**
- Q2: Is 30s progressive timeout increment correct?
- Q6: Persona timeout vs workflow step timeout priority?
- Q7: What if repository resolution fails (all fallbacks)?
- Q8: Should we validate path traversal in repoDirectoryFor()?
- Q9: Should we track retry history (attempt-by-attempt log)?
- Q12: Should blockage analysis be cached across attempts?
- Q13: Should repository clones be cached/reused?
- Q14: Should timeout error messages include detailed context?
- Q15: Should blocked tasks auto-retry after delay?

**Implementation Gaps Identified:**
1. No explicit `MAX_UNBLOCK_ATTEMPTS` constant
2. No escalation logic after max attempts
3. No error type detection (isRetryableError)
4. No path traversal validation
5. No retry history tracking

**Test Improvements Recommended:**
1. Add error type tests (network, database, LLM, validation)
2. Add retry exhaustion tests (workflow abort?)
3. Add timeout accuracy tests (progressive calculation)
4. Add blocked task state machine tests
5. Add repository resolution error tests

- `tests/blockedTaskResolution.test.ts` (299 lines)
- `tests/repoResolutionFallback.test.ts` (72 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Complete + User Approved (Oct 19, 2025)  
**Deliverables:**
- `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_4_ERROR_HANDLING.md` (analysis) ✅
- `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_4_USER_DECISIONS.md` (decisions) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Progressive Timeout:** Each retry gets +30s more timeout (e.g., 90s → 120s → 150s)
- ⚠️ **No Delays Between Retries:** Retries happen immediately (unlike Test Group 3's exponential backoff)
- ✅ **Persona-Specific Timeouts:** context (60s), lead-engineer (90s), qa-engineer (120s)
- ✅ **Persona-Specific Max Retries:** context (3), lead-engineer (5), qa-engineer (unlimited)
- ⚠️ **Blocked Task Attempt Tracking:** Increments counter, but no explicit max limit or escalation
- ✅ **Repository Resolution Fallback:** Local → HTTPS clone → repository field → fail

**Critical Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ **Inconsistent Retry Strategy** → ✅ Unified exponential backoff for all operations
- ❌ **Unlimited QA Retries** → ✅ Configurable max (default 10), can be "unlimited" with warning
- ❌ **No Escalation Path** → ✅ Abort workflow with diagnostic logs on exhaustion
- ❌ **No Error Type Detection** → ✅ Deferred (exponential backoff handles all cases)

**USER CHECKPOINT #6: Error Handling Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**User Decisions:**
1. **Q1 (Retry Strategy):** ✅ Use exponential backoff for all retries (align with task creation)
2. **Q3 (QA Max Retries):** ✅ All loops have configurable max (default 10), can accept "unlimited"
3. **Q4 (Unblock Limit):** ✅ All loops have configurable max (default 10), can accept "unlimited"
4. **Q5 (Escalation):** ✅ For now, abort workflow with diagnostic logs
5. **Q10 (Workflow Abort):** ✅ For now, abort workflow with diagnostic logs (consistent)
6. **Q11 (Error Types):** ✅ No error type detection for now - allow backoff logic to run its course

**Implementation Plan (Phase 4):**
- Replace progressive timeout with exponential backoff in PersonaRequestStep
- Update all max retry defaults: 3 → 10 (QA can be configured as unlimited with warning)
- Add cfg.maxUnblockAttempts = 10 (configurable, can be unlimited with warning)
- Add abort signal support to StepResult interface
- Update WorkflowEngine to handle abort signals
- Add comprehensive diagnostic logging for all retry exhaustion scenarios
- Add startup validation warnings when unlimited retries configured
- Test abort propagation end-to-end

**Code Changes:** ~350 lines added/modified
- PersonaRequestStep: ~100 lines (exponential backoff)
- UnblockAttemptStep: ~50 lines (max attempts + abort)
- WorkflowEngine: ~30 lines (abort handling)
- Config: ~20 lines (max retry defaults)
- Diagnostic logging: ~150 lines (comprehensive logs)

**Approval:** ✅ APPROVED - Proceed to Test Group 5

**Deliverable:** `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_5_USER_DECISIONS.md` (approved decisions) ✅

**Key Approved Changes:**
- ✅ **QA Severity Adoption:** SEVERE=unrunnable/compile errors, HIGH=failing tests, MEDIUM=poor structure, LOW=suggestions
- ✅ **DevOps Severity Adoption:** SEVERE=failing builds, LOW=improvement suggestions, HIGH/MEDIUM inferred
- ✅ **Universal Iteration Limits:** All personas have configurable max attempts (abort on exhaustion, except plan-evaluator)
- ✅ **Plan Evaluator Exception:** Failed plans proceed to implementation after max approval attempts (unique behavior)
- ✅ **Universal Stage Detection:** All reviews use MVP/POC/beta/production awareness for PM context
- ✅ **Unified Response Format:** All reviews use severity-based JSON {status, summary, findings: {severe, high, medium, low}}
- ✅ **Complete TDD Awareness:** All workflow stages receive TDD context, special handling for Red phase (failing tests expected)

**USER CHECKPOINT #7: Cross-Review Consistency Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED (All 18 critical questions answered comprehensively)

**Critical Decisions Made:**
1. **Q1-Q3 (QA Severity):** ✅ Adopt SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with clear mapping to test failures
2. **Q4-Q6 (DevOps Consistency):** ✅ Adopt severity levels with build/test/SAST failure classification
3. **Q7-Q9 (Iteration Limits):** ✅ All personas have configurable limits, abort on max (except plan-evaluator proceeds)
4. **Q10-Q12 (Stage Detection):** ✅ All reviews use stage detection, PM examines milestone maturity
5. **Q13-Q15 (Response Format):** ✅ All reviews use severity-based JSON format (standardized structure)
6. **Q16-Q18 (TDD Completeness):** ✅ All reviews receive TDD context, Red phase allows failing tests

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **Unified Severity Model:** All 4 review types now use identical 4-tier classification
- ✅ **Consistent TDD Handling:** All reviewers understand when failing tests are intentional
- ✅ **Stage-Aware PM:** Project maturity affects task prioritization (early stage can defer non-critical suggestions)
- ✅ **Universal Iteration Safety:** Prevents infinite loops across all review types
- ✅ **Plan Evaluation Special Case:** Failed plans proceed to implementation (prevents analysis paralysis)

**Implementation Roadmap:**
- Phase 4 (Week 7): Persona prompts + severity implementation (~300 lines)
- Phase 5 (Week 8): Workflow integration + PM context (~350 lines)
- Phase 6 (Week 9): Testing + validation (~300 lines)
- **Total:** ~950 lines estimated (persona prompts, workflows, PM context, steps, tests)

**See:** 
- `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_5_CROSS_REVIEW_CONSISTENCY.md` for complete analysis

## Risk Log

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| User validation delays | High | Schedule regular checkpoints, async communication | Active |
| SQLite performance issues | Medium | Load test early, can migrate to PostgreSQL | Monitoring |
| Breaking workflows during migration | High | Feature flags, gradual rollout, git rollback plan | Planned |
| Losing functionality during refactor | Medium | Test-first approach, behavior tests capture all scenarios | Mitigated |
| Test rationalization uncovers conflicting requirements | Medium | User checkpoints at each test group | Active |

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Oct 19, 2025 - Initial Planning
- **Decision:** API design first, ignore legacy completely
- **Decision:** Test rationalization with user validation at EVERY checkpoint
- **Decision:** No refactoring until all 5 test groups validated
- **Reason:** Previous tactical fixes (milestone bugs) showed need for systemic solution
- **Approval:** Refactor plan approved

### Oct 19, 2025 - Workflow Rationalization Added
- **Decision:** Add Phase 0 for workflow rationalization BEFORE API design
- **Reason:** feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml are unused/legacy
- **Key Point:** `legacy-compatible-task-flow` is the main driver
- **Goal:** Decompose workflows into reusable sub-workflow patterns
- **Timeline:** Extended from 9 weeks to 10 weeks
- **User Checkpoints:** Increased from 5 to 8 (added 3 for workflow/API phases)
- **Status:** Ready to start Phase 0

### Oct 19, 2025 - Self-Contained Architecture Emphasis
- **Decision:** Dashboard backend must be completely self-contained
- **Requirement:** Can be extracted to separate repo with zero effort
- **Requirement:** HTTP boundary only, no direct imports from parent
