## Phase 0: Workflow Rationalization (PREREQUISITE)
**Timeline:** Week 1 (Oct 19 - Oct 25, 2025)  
**Goal:** Analyze and rationalize YAML workflows, establish reusable patterns

### Background
The current workflows directory contains multiple workflow files, some of which are unused or legacy. The main driver is `legacy-compatible-task-flow`, but the workflow structure needs rationalization to:
1. Identify which workflows are actually in use
2. Decompose workflows into reusable sub-workflow patterns
3. Ensure consistency across workflow implementations
4. Remove/archive unused workflows

### Tasks

- [x] **Day 1: Workflow Inventory & Analysis**
  - [x] List all workflow files in `workflows/` directory
  - [x] Identify which workflows are actively used in production
  - [x] Document `legacy-compatible-task-flow` structure and usage
  - [x] Map workflow dependencies and relationships
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete (Oct 19, 2025)
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.md` ✅
  
  **Key Findings:**
  - 12 workflow files total (3 in `/workflows`, 9 in `/src/workflows/definitions`)
  - `legacy-compatible-task-flow` (446 lines) is primary driver (95%+ usage)
  - Only 3-4 workflows actively used, rest are unused/duplicates
  - **3 different implementations** for review failure handling (QA, code, security)
  - Dashboard task creation is N+1 problem (needs bulk endpoint)
  - Workflow too complex (30 steps, needs decomposition)

- [x] **Day 2: Pattern Extraction**
  - [x] Identify common patterns across workflows
  - [x] Document dashboard interaction patterns (task creation, updates, queries)
  - [x] Identify review patterns (QA, Code Review, Security)
  - [x] Identify coordination patterns (PM evaluation, TDD gates)
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete (Oct 19, 2025)
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_PATTERNS.md` ✅
  
  **Key Findings:**
  - **7 major patterns identified:** Git ops, task status, review execution, review failure handling, planning/implementation, iteration loops, milestone ops
  - **Review failure handling has 3 implementations:** QAFailureCoordinationStep (embedded PM), ReviewFailureTasksStep (separate PM), copy-paste for security
  - **530 lines of duplication** in review failure handling (can reduce to 50 lines)
  - **Dashboard N+1 problem confirmed:** Sequential task creation needs bulk endpoint
  - **6 dashboard operations documented:** Status updates, task creation, milestone queries, etc.
  - **PM prompts embedded in YAML:** 450+ lines total, should be externalized

- [x] **Day 3: Sub-Workflow Design** ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 19, 2025)

  - [x] Define sub-workflow interfaces (inputs/outputs)
  - [x] Map how sub-workflows compose into full workflows
  - [x] Identify opportunities for standardization
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/SUB_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md` ✅
  - **Key Findings:**
    - **3 sub-workflows designed:** review-failure-handling (Priority 1), task-implementation (Priority 2), git-operations (Priority 3)
    - **530 → 60 lines reduction** for review failures (89% reduction)
    - **446 → 200 lines reduction** for main workflow (55% reduction)
    - **Total: 976 → 260 lines** (73% reduction)
    - **Bulk task creation strategy** defined (fixes N+1 problem)
    - **PM prompt externalization** (450+ lines → single template)

**Approval:** ❌ Not Yet Approved

**Decision:** Proceed to Phase 3 (Test Rationalization) to validate business intent before full workflow integration.

---

## Phase 3: Test Rationalization
**Timeline:** Weeks 4-6 (Nov 16 - Dec 6, 2025)  
**Goal:** Extract and validate business intent from existing tests  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress - Test Group 1 Complete (Oct 19, 2025) ✅

**Progress:** 20% Complete (1 of 5 test groups analyzed)

### Week 4: Test Groups 1-3

#### Test Group 1: Review Trigger Logic ✅ APPROVED
**Files Analyzed:**
- `tests/qaFailureCoordination.test.ts` (177 lines)
- `tests/reviewFlowValidation.test.ts` (178 lines)
- `tests/tddGovernanceGate.test.ts` (45 lines)

**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete + User Approved (Oct 19, 2025)  
**Deliverable:** `docs/test-rationalization/TEST_GROUP_1_REVIEW_TRIGGERS.md` (635 lines) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All 4 workflows use identical review trigger pattern: `fail || unknown`
- ✅ Sequential review flow: QA → Code → Security → DevOps → Done
- ⚠️ TDD governance: Reviews should be context-aware (needs verification)
- ❌ **BUG FOUND:** DevOps failures don't block task completion or trigger PM eval
- ✅ 5 test scenarios extracted (triggers, dependencies, TDD, cycles, QA loop)
- ✅ 7 questions answered by user
- ✅ 3 recommendations approved

**USER CHECKPOINT #3: Review Trigger Logic Validation**  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**User Decisions:**
1. ✅ `unknown` status triggers PM eval (same as `fail`) - CONFIRMED
2. ⚠️ TDD: Reviews should understand task goal might be failing test (verify implementation)
3. ❌ DevOps failures SHOULD trigger PM eval (BUG - not currently implemented)
4. ✅ Only 3 statuses (pass/fail/unknown), anything not "pass" → PM eval
5. ✅ No security-sensitive task metadata needed
6. ✅ All reviews trigger PM eval, PM handles severity/duplication
7. ⚠️ Make `tdd_aware` default, investigate `workflow_mode` purpose

**Action Items (High Priority):**
- ❌ Fix DevOps review failure handling (add `pm_prioritize_devops_failures` step)
- ⚠️ Verify TDD context passed to review prompts
- ⚠️ Test reviewers don't fail tasks with intentional failing tests

**Approval:** ✅ APPROVED

## Notes & Decisions

### Oct 19, 2025 - Initial Planning
- **Decision:** API design first, ignore legacy completely
- **Decision:** Test rationalization with user validation at EVERY checkpoint
- **Decision:** No refactoring until all 5 test groups validated
- **Reason:** Previous tactical fixes (milestone bugs) showed need for systemic solution
- **Approval:** Refactor plan approved

### Oct 19, 2025 - Workflow Rationalization Added
- **Decision:** Add Phase 0 for workflow rationalization BEFORE API design
- **Reason:** feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml are unused/legacy
- **Key Point:** `legacy-compatible-task-flow` is the main driver
- **Goal:** Decompose workflows into reusable sub-workflow patterns
- **Timeline:** Extended from 9 weeks to 10 weeks
- **User Checkpoints:** Increased from 5 to 8 (added 3 for workflow/API phases)
- **Status:** Ready to start Phase 0

### Oct 19, 2025 - Self-Contained Architecture Emphasis
- **Decision:** Dashboard backend must be completely self-contained
- **Requirement:** Can be extracted to separate repo with zero effort
- **Requirement:** HTTP boundary only, no direct imports from parent
