## Phase 0: Workflow Rationalization (PREREQUISITE)
**Timeline:** Week 1 (Oct 19 - Oct 25, 2025)  
**Goal:** Analyze and rationalize YAML workflows, establish reusable patterns

### Background
The current workflows directory contains multiple workflow files, some of which are unused or legacy. The main driver is `legacy-compatible-task-flow`, but the workflow structure needs rationalization to:
1. Identify which workflows are actually in use
2. Decompose workflows into reusable sub-workflow patterns
3. Ensure consistency across workflow implementations
4. Remove/archive unused workflows

### Tasks

- [x] **Day 1: Workflow Inventory & Analysis**
  - [x] List all workflow files in `workflows/` directory
  - [x] Identify which workflows are actively used in production
  - [x] Document `legacy-compatible-task-flow` structure and usage
  - [x] Map workflow dependencies and relationships
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete (Oct 19, 2025)
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.md` ✅
  
  **Key Findings:**
  - 12 workflow files total (3 in `/workflows`, 9 in `/src/workflows/definitions`)
  - `legacy-compatible-task-flow` (446 lines) is primary driver (95%+ usage)
  - Only 3-4 workflows actively used, rest are unused/duplicates
  - **3 different implementations** for review failure handling (QA, code, security)
  - Dashboard task creation is N+1 problem (needs bulk endpoint)
  - Workflow too complex (30 steps, needs decomposition)

- [x] **Day 2: Pattern Extraction**
  - [x] Identify common patterns across workflows
  - [x] Document dashboard interaction patterns (task creation, updates, queries)
  - [x] Identify review patterns (QA, Code Review, Security)
  - [x] Identify coordination patterns (PM evaluation, TDD gates)
  - **Status:** ✅ Complete (Oct 19, 2025)
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/WORKFLOW_PATTERNS.md` ✅
  
  **Key Findings:**
  - **7 major patterns identified:** Git ops, task status, review execution, review failure handling, planning/implementation, iteration loops, milestone ops
  - **Review failure handling has 3 implementations:** QAFailureCoordinationStep (embedded PM), ReviewFailureTasksStep (separate PM), copy-paste for security
  - **530 lines of duplication** in review failure handling (can reduce to 50 lines)
  - **Dashboard N+1 problem confirmed:** Sequential task creation needs bulk endpoint
  - **6 dashboard operations documented:** Status updates, task creation, milestone queries, etc.
  - **PM prompts embedded in YAML:** 450+ lines total, should be externalized

- [x] **Day 3: Sub-Workflow Design** ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 19, 2025)
  - [x] Design reusable sub-workflow components
  - [x] Define sub-workflow interfaces (inputs/outputs)
  - [x] Map how sub-workflows compose into full workflows
  - [x] Identify opportunities for standardization
  - **Status:** Complete
  - **Deliverable:** `docs/workflows/SUB_WORKFLOW_DESIGN.md` ✅
  - **Key Findings:**
    - **3 sub-workflows designed:** review-failure-handling (Priority 1), task-implementation (Priority 2), git-operations (Priority 3)
    - **530 → 60 lines reduction** for review failures (89% reduction)
    - **446 → 200 lines reduction** for main workflow (55% reduction)
    - **Total: 976 → 260 lines** (73% reduction)
    - **Bulk task creation strategy** defined (fixes N+1 problem)
    - **PM prompt externalization** (450+ lines → single template)
    - **5 new step types identified:** SubWorkflowStep, BulkTaskCreationStep, PMDecisionParserStep, ConditionalStep, VariableResolutionStep

**Goal:** Finish remaining dashboard endpoints, full production validation

### Tasks
- [ ] **Remaining Endpoints**
  - [ ] Milestone listing/filtering
  - [ ] Task status updates
  - [ ] Query/search endpoints
  - [ ] Project status endpoint
  - **Status:** Not Started

- [ ] **Production Monitoring**
  - [ ] Monitor error rates
  - [ ] Monitor performance
  - [ ] Validate all workflows end-to-end
  - **Status:** Not Started

- [ ] **Final Documentation**
  - [ ] Complete OpenAPI spec
  - [ ] Usage examples
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide
  - **Status:** Not Started

## Success Criteria Tracking

### Dashboard Backend
- [ ] Dashboard backend is self-contained project (can run standalone)
- [ ] Clean HTTP API boundary (no direct imports from main project)
- [ ] All 264+ existing tests pass with new backend
- [ ] Load test: 1000 tasks created in <1 second
- [ ] Zero 422 "Unknown milestone" errors in production
- [ ] Bulk sync endpoint reduces API calls by 90%+
- [ ] Dashboard backend can be extracted to separate repo with zero effort

### Review Consolidation
- [ ] Single ReviewFailureService used by all review types
- [ ] QA, Code Review, Security Review use identical code paths
- [ ] Test suite reduced by 30%+ lines via consolidation
- [ ] YAML workflow under 300 lines (from 600+)
- [ ] Zero references to "legacy" in workflow code
- [ ] All review types handle PM responses consistently

## Risk Log

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| User validation delays | High | Schedule regular checkpoints, async communication | Active |
| SQLite performance issues | Medium | Load test early, can migrate to PostgreSQL | Monitoring |
| Breaking workflows during migration | High | Feature flags, gradual rollout, git rollback plan | Planned |
| Losing functionality during refactor | Medium | Test-first approach, behavior tests capture all scenarios | Mitigated |
| Test rationalization uncovers conflicting requirements | Medium | User checkpoints at each test group | Active |

## Notes & Decisions

### Oct 19, 2025 - Initial Planning
- **Decision:** API design first, ignore legacy completely
- **Decision:** Test rationalization with user validation at EVERY checkpoint
- **Decision:** No refactoring until all 5 test groups validated
- **Reason:** Previous tactical fixes (milestone bugs) showed need for systemic solution
- **Approval:** Refactor plan approved

### Oct 19, 2025 - Workflow Rationalization Added
- **Decision:** Add Phase 0 for workflow rationalization BEFORE API design
- **Reason:** feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml are unused/legacy
- **Key Point:** `legacy-compatible-task-flow` is the main driver
- **Goal:** Decompose workflows into reusable sub-workflow patterns
- **Timeline:** Extended from 9 weeks to 10 weeks
- **User Checkpoints:** Increased from 5 to 8 (added 3 for workflow/API phases)
- **Status:** Ready to start Phase 0

### Oct 19, 2025 - Self-Contained Architecture Emphasis
- **Decision:** Dashboard backend must be completely self-contained
- **Requirement:** Can be extracted to separate repo with zero effort
- **Requirement:** HTTP boundary only, no direct imports from parent

## Development Standards

### Commit Messages
- **Style:** Single line, concise (50-72 characters max)
- **Format:** `type(scope): brief description`
- **Examples:**
  - `feat(dashboard): add bulk task creation endpoint`
  - `fix(workflow): resolve milestone resolution bug`
  - `refactor(review): consolidate failure handling`
  - `test(behavior): add PM decision parsing tests`
  - `docs(tracker): update Phase 2 progress`
- **Types:** feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf
- **No:** Multi-line commits, bullet points in commit message, verbose explanations
- **Why:** Clean git history, easier to scan, better for tools/scripts
