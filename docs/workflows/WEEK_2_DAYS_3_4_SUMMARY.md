# Week 2 Progress: Days 3-4 Complete

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Task:** Migrate conditional workflows to unified pattern  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Day 3-4: Conditional Workflow Migration

### in-review-task-flow.yaml ‚Üí v2.0.0 ‚úÖ

**Before:** 266 lines with inline PM evaluation and ReviewFailureTasksStep  
**After:** 178 lines using review-failure-handling sub-workflow  
**Reduction:** 88 lines removed (33% reduction)

**Changes:**
1. **Replaced inline PM evaluation** with SubWorkflowStep calls
   - Code review failures ‚Üí review-failure-handling sub-workflow
   - Security review failures ‚Üí review-failure-handling sub-workflow
   - DevOps review failures ‚Üí review-failure-handling sub-workflow

2. **Added TDD awareness** to all review failure handlers
   - `tdd_aware: "${tdd_aware || false}"`
   - `tdd_stage: "${tdd_stage || 'implementation'}"`
   - `existing_tasks: []` (TODO: dashboard query)

3. **Removed inline steps:**
   - `pm_prioritize_code_review_failures` (now in sub-workflow)
   - `create_code_review_followup_tasks` (now BulkTaskCreationStep)
   - `mark_task_needs_rework` (now in sub-workflow)
   - Same for security review

4. **Consistent pattern** with task-flow.yaml v3.0.0
   - All review types use same unified pattern
   - Same priority scores (code=1000, security=1500, DevOps=1100)
   - Same duplicate detection approach

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No more copy-paste for each review type
- ‚úÖ Centralized PM evaluation logic
- ‚úÖ TDD-aware review failures
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection support
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain (one place to fix bugs)

### blocked-task-resolution.yaml ‚Üí v2.0.0 ‚úÖ

**Before:** 169 lines without TDD awareness  
**After:** 193 lines with TDD context  
**Change:** +24 lines (TDD context additions)

**Changes:**
1. **Added TDD variables:**
   ```yaml
   variables:
     tdd_aware: "${tdd_aware || false}"
     tdd_stage: "${tdd_stage || 'implementation'}"
   ```

2. **Enhanced lead engineer payload:**
   - Receives `tdd_aware` and `tdd_stage` flags
   - Gets TDD context explanation:
     - Stage meanings (write_failing_test, failing_test, implementation, passing_test)
     - Warning when in failing_test stage (expected failures)
     - Context-aware unblock analysis

3. **TDD Context Template:**
   ```yaml
   tdd_context: |
     TDD Context: ${tdd_aware ? 'This task is part of a test-driven development workflow' : 'Not TDD-aware'}
     ${tdd_aware ? 'TDD Stage: ' + tdd_stage : ''}
     
     TDD Stage Meanings:
     - write_failing_test: Writing test that should fail
     - failing_test: Test exists and is failing (EXPECTED during TDD)
     - implementation: Implementing code to make test pass
     - passing_test: Test is passing, refactoring may be in progress
     
     ${tdd_aware && tdd_stage === 'failing_test' ? '‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION: Failing tests may be EXPECTED at this stage. Verify if blockage is legitimate.' : ''}
   ```

4. **Architecture notes added:**
   - v2.0.0 adds TDD awareness
   - Lead engineer receives TDD context
   - Does NOT use review-failure-handling (unblocking is domain-specific)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Lead engineer knows when failing tests are expected
- ‚úÖ Prevents inappropriate unblock attempts during TDD workflow
- ‚úÖ Better context for blockage analysis
- ‚úÖ Consistent with task-flow.yaml TDD patterns

## Why blocked-task-resolution Doesn't Use Sub-Workflows

**Decision:** Keep blocked-task-resolution as standalone workflow

**Reasoning:**
1. **Domain-specific logic:** Unblock analysis is unique (not review/implementation)
2. **No duplication:** Doesn't repeat patterns from other workflows
3. **Custom steps:** Uses BlockedTaskAnalysisStep, UnblockAttemptStep (specialized)
4. **Iteration tracking:** Manages attempt counts and max attempts
5. **Validation required:** QA validates unblock success

**TDD awareness added:** To provide context to lead engineer, but core logic remains unique.

**Days Complete:** 4 of 7 (57%)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Day 1: DevOps review failure handling
- ‚úÖ Day 2: Deleted 8 unused workflows (1,994 lines)

**Commit 6cfc9b3:** feat(workflow): migrate conditional workflows to unified pattern (in-review v2.0, blocked-resolution v2.0)
- 2 files changed, 107 insertions(+), 169 deletions(-)
- Net reduction: 62 lines

## Next: Day 5

Create hotfix-task-flow.yaml for emergency fixes:
- Abbreviated review process
- Higher priority than normal tasks
- Skip some non-critical steps (e.g., DevOps review optional)
- Fast-track to production
