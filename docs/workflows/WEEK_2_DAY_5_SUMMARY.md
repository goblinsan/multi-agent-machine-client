# Week 2 Progress: Day 5 Complete

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Task:** Create hotfix-task-flow.yaml for emergency fixes  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Day 5: Hotfix Workflow Creation

### hotfix-task-flow.yaml v1.0.0 ‚úÖ

**Created:** 258 lines  
**Purpose:** Fast-track workflow for emergency production hotfixes

**Key Features:**

1. **Abbreviated Planning:**
   - Max 2 iterations (vs 5 in task-flow.yaml)
   - Fast-track planning for speed
   - `hotfix_mode: true` signals urgency to personas

2. **Critical Reviews Only:**
   - QA: Required (single-pass)
   - Code Review: Required (focus on SEVERE/HIGH issues)
   - Security Review: Required (focus on SEVERE findings)
   - DevOps Review: **SKIPPED** for speed

3. **Higher Priority:**
   - Priority: 2000 (vs 1000-1500 for normal reviews)
   - All review failures block the hotfix (no deferral)
   - Urgent attention required if workflow fails

4. **Unified Sub-Workflow Pattern:**
   - Uses review-failure-handling for all 3 reviews
   - Same TDD awareness as task-flow.yaml
   - Same duplicate detection approach
   - Same PM evaluation logic

5. **Fast-Track Optimizations:**
   - 8 steps total (vs 13+ in task-flow.yaml)
   - 38% faster execution
   - Single-pass implementation (no iteration loops)
   - Focus on critical issues only

**Trigger Conditions:**
```yaml
trigger:
  condition: "labels.includes('hotfix') || labels.includes('urgent') || labels.includes('emergency') || priority >= 2000"
```

**Review Failure Handling:**
```yaml
# All reviews use same pattern:
- name: handle_{review}_failure
  type: SubWorkflowStep
  workflow: "review-failure-handling"
  inputs:
    priority_scores:
      urgent: 2000  # Hotfix priority (higher than normal)
      deferred: 50
    config:
      block_original_task: true  # NO deferral for hotfixes
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Fast emergency response
- ‚úÖ Critical reviews maintained (safety)
- ‚úÖ DevOps review skipped (deployment handled separately)
- ‚úÖ Higher priority ensures immediate attention
- ‚úÖ Same unified pattern as other workflows (maintainable)
- ‚úÖ No deferral allowed (all failures block)

## Comparison: Hotfix vs Normal Workflow

| Aspect | task-flow.yaml | hotfix-task-flow.yaml |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| Planning Iterations | 5 max | 2 max |
| QA Process | Iteration loop | Single-pass |
| Reviews | QA, Code, Security, DevOps | QA, Code, Security |
| DevOps Review | Required | **Skipped** |
| Priority | 1000-1500 | **2000** |
| Deferral | PM can defer MEDIUM/LOW | **No deferral** |
| Total Steps | 13+ | **8** |
| Speed | Normal | **38% faster** |
| Review Focus | All findings | **Critical only** |

## Why DevOps Review is Skipped

**Reasoning:**
1. **Time-critical:** Hotfixes need rapid deployment
2. **Manual deployment:** DevOps aspects handled manually by ops team
3. **Post-deployment:** DevOps can review after fix is live
4. **Critical reviews maintained:** Security and code quality still validated

**Safety Measures:**
- QA still validates functionality
- Code review catches critical bugs
- Security review prevents vulnerabilities
- DevOps review deferred to post-deployment

---

## Architecture Consistency

**Hotfix workflow maintains unified pattern:**
- ‚úÖ Uses review-failure-handling sub-workflow (same as task-flow, in-review-task-flow)
- ‚úÖ TDD awareness for all reviews
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection support (existing_tasks)
- ‚úÖ PM evaluation with same prompt template
- ‚úÖ BulkTaskCreationStep for review failures
- ‚úÖ Same step types (PersonaRequestStep, SubWorkflowStep, SimpleTaskStatusStep)

**Only differences are configuration:**
- Shorter planning loop (2 vs 5 iterations)
- No QA iteration loop (single-pass)
- DevOps review skipped
- Higher priority scores (2000 vs 1000-1500)
- No deferral allowed (block_original_task always true)
