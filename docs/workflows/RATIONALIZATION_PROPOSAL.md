## Current State Assessment

### Workflow Inventory

| Location | File | Lines | Status | Usage |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| `/workflows` | feature.yml | 108 | ‚ùå Unused | Not loaded by WorkflowEngine |
| `/workflows` | hotfix.yml | 62 | ‚ùå Unused | Not loaded by WorkflowEngine |
| `/workflows` | project-loop.yml | 87 | ‚ùå Unused | Not loaded by WorkflowEngine |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml | 446 | ‚úÖ Active | **Primary (95%+)** |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | project-loop.yaml | 87 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback | Rarely used |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | in-review-task-flow.yaml | 195 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional | <1% usage |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | blocked-task-resolution.yaml | 215 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional | <1% usage |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | feature.yaml | 108 | ‚ùå Duplicate | Copy of /workflows/feature.yml |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | hotfix.yaml | 62 | ‚ùå Duplicate | Copy of /workflows/hotfix.yml |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | code-review-followup.yaml | ~150 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Not referenced |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | qa-iteration.yaml | ~100 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Not referenced |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | security-hardening.yaml | ~120 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Not referenced |

**Total:** 12 workflows, ~1,840 lines  
**Active:** 1 primary + 3 conditional = 4 workflows  
**Unused:** 8 workflows (43% of total)

### Problem Analysis

**1. Duplication Across Files**
- `/workflows` vs `/src/workflows/definitions` - same files, different locations
- WorkflowEngine only loads from `/src/workflows/definitions`
- 3 files completely ignored (feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml in /workflows)

**2. Duplication Within Files**
- Review failure handling: 530 lines across 3 implementations
- Git operations: Repeated in multiple workflows
- Task status updates: Copy-paste pattern everywhere

**3. Monolithic Workflows**
- `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml`: 446 lines, 30 steps, does everything
- No reusable components
- Hard to test, debug, or modify

**4. Unused Workflows**
- 8 workflows never referenced in production
- Unclear which are intentional vs abandoned
- No deprecation markers or documentation

**5. Workflow Selection Confusion**
- WorkflowCoordinator tries: legacy-compatible ‚Üí findWorkflowByCondition ‚Üí project-loop
- `findWorkflowByCondition` rarely matches
- 95%+ tasks use legacy-compatible-task-flow

---

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Workflows (5)

1. **legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml** (v2.0) - Primary workflow
   - 446 ‚Üí 200 lines (55% reduction)
   - Uses sub-workflows for common patterns
   - Handles: git setup ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí reviews ‚Üí completion

2. **project-loop.yaml** - Fallback workflow
   - Keep as-is (87 lines)
   - Used when legacy-compatible not applicable
   - Minimal changes needed

3. **in-review-task-flow.yaml** - Conditional workflow
   - Refactor to use review-failure-handling sub-workflow
   - Reduce from 195 ‚Üí ~100 lines
   - Used for tasks already in review status

4. **blocked-task-resolution.yaml** - Conditional workflow
   - Refactor to use task-implementation sub-workflow
   - Reduce from 215 ‚Üí ~120 lines
   - Used for unblocking tasks

5. **hotfix-task-flow.yaml** (NEW) - Fast-track workflow
   - Merge hotfix.yaml concepts with sub-workflows
   - Minimal planning, fast implementation, expedited review
   - ~80 lines

### Sub-Workflows (3)

1. **review-failure-handling.yaml** (NEW) ‚≠ê Priority 1
   - Unified review failure coordination
   - 50 lines, replaces 530 lines
   - Used by: legacy-compatible, in-review-task-flow, hotfix-task-flow

2. **task-implementation.yaml** (NEW) üîß Priority 2
   - Reusable planning + implementation
   - ~60 lines
   - Used by: legacy-compatible, blocked-task-resolution, hotfix-task-flow

3. **git-operations.yaml** (NEW) üåø Priority 3
   - Standard git setup pattern
   - ~30 lines
   - Used by: all workflows

### Archived/Deleted (8)

**Archive** (move to `/src/workflows/archive/`):
- `code-review-followup.yaml` - Unused, replaced by review-failure-handling
- `qa-iteration.yaml` - Unused, logic in QAIterationLoopStep
- `security-hardening.yaml` - Unused, unclear intent
- `feature.yaml` - Duplicate of /workflows/feature.yml
- `hotfix.yaml` - Duplicate, merged into hotfix-task-flow

**Delete** (remove entirely):
- `/workflows/feature.yml` - Not loaded, outdated
- `/workflows/hotfix.yml` - Not loaded, outdated
- `/workflows/project-loop.yml` - Not loaded, duplicate of definitions version

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implement Sub-Workflows (Week 1)
**Goal:** Create reusable sub-workflow components

**Step 1.1: Implement SubWorkflowStep (Day 1-2)**
- [ ] Create `SubWorkflowStep.ts` in `src/workflows/steps/`
- [ ] Implement sub-workflow loading from `sub-workflows/` directory
- [ ] Implement input validation against schema
- [ ] Implement isolated execution context
- [ ] Implement output mapping back to parent
- [ ] Add unit tests for SubWorkflowStep
- **Risk:** Medium - New step type, needs thorough testing
- **Mitigation:** Test in isolation before workflow integration

**Step 1.2: Implement Support Steps (Day 2-3)**
- [ ] `BulkTaskCreationStep.ts` - Bulk dashboard API calls
- [ ] `PMDecisionParserStep.ts` - Normalize PM decisions
- [ ] `ConditionalStep.ts` - Conditional execution logic
- [ ] `VariableResolutionStep.ts` - Variable resolution
- [ ] Unit tests for each step type
- **Risk:** Low - Simple step implementations
- **Dependencies:** Dashboard bulk endpoint (can mock for now)

**Step 1.3: Create Sub-Workflow Files (Day 3-4)**
- [ ] `src/workflows/sub-workflows/review-failure-handling.yaml`
- [ ] `src/workflows/sub-workflows/task-implementation.yaml`
- [ ] `src/workflows/sub-workflows/git-operations.yaml`
- [ ] Create `prompts/pm-review-prioritization.txt`
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax and schema
- **Risk:** Low - Pure YAML, no code changes
- **Testing:** Can validate offline before integration

**Step 1.4: Integration Tests (Day 4-5)**
- [ ] Test sub-workflow execution in isolation
- [ ] Test parent ‚Üí sub-workflow ‚Üí parent data flow
- [ ] Test error handling and rollback
- [ ] Test with mock dashboard API
- **Risk:** Medium - Complex integration scenarios
- **Mitigation:** Start with git-operations (simplest), then task-implementation, then review-failure-handling

**Deliverable:** Working sub-workflow system, ready for workflow migration

---

### Phase 2: Migrate legacy-compatible-task-flow (Week 2)
**Goal:** Refactor primary workflow to use sub-workflows

**Revised Strategy (No Feature Flags):**

**Step 2.1: Development Testing (Day 1-2)**
- [ ] Create refactored workflow in development branch
- [ ] Replace review failure steps with sub-workflow calls
- [ ] Replace implementation steps with task-implementation sub-workflow
- [ ] Replace git steps with git-operations sub-workflow
- [ ] Run full test suite in development
- [ ] Manual testing of all review paths (QA, code, security)
- **Risk:** Medium - Need comprehensive testing
- **Success Criteria:** All tests pass, manual testing successful

**Step 2.2: Integration Testing (Day 2-3)**
- [ ] Deploy to staging/test environment
- [ ] Run against real Redis streams (test data)
- [ ] Test all persona interactions
- [ ] Test all review failure scenarios
- [ ] Verify bulk task creation works
- [ ] Compare outputs with production behavior
- **Risk:** Medium - Need environment parity
- **Success Criteria:** 100% feature parity with production

**Step 2.3: Production Deployment (Day 3-4)**
- [ ] Schedule deployment during low-activity period
- [ ] Deploy sub-workflows first (unused initially, safe)
- [ ] Deploy refactored workflow + new step types
- [ ] Monitor first 10 tasks closely
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- **Risk:** Medium - Direct production deployment
- **Mitigation:** Deploy during low activity, close monitoring
- **Rollback:** Git revert ready (~5 min)

**Step 2.4: Monitoring & Validation (Day 4-5)**
- [ ] Compare metrics: task timing, success rate, API calls
- [ ] Verify bulk task creation working (fewer dashboard calls)
- [ ] Check for any error patterns
- [ ] Validate PM decisions match previous behavior
- [ ] Confirm all review types working
- **Risk:** Low - Just monitoring
- **Success Criteria:** Metrics match or improve vs baseline

**Deliverable:** Primary workflow using sub-workflows, 55% smaller, 100% feature parity

---

### Phase 3: Migrate Conditional Workflows (Week 2, Days 6-10)
**Goal:** Apply sub-workflow pattern to all remaining workflows

**User Decision:** Complete workflow consolidation NOW (informs dashboard + test design)

**Step 3.1: Refactor in-review-task-flow.yaml (Day 6-7)**
- [ ] Use review-failure-handling sub-workflow for all review types
- [ ] Simplify logic (task already in review, just needs review coordination)
- [ ] Reduce from 195 ‚Üí ~100 lines
- [ ] Test with tasks in "in_review" status
- **Risk:** Low - straightforward sub-workflow usage
- **Timeline:** 2 days

**Step 3.2: Refactor blocked-task-resolution.yaml (Day 7-8)**
- [ ] Use task-implementation sub-workflow
- [ ] Focus on unblocking logic + re-implementation
- [ ] Reduce from 215 ‚Üí ~120 lines
- [ ] Test with blocked tasks
- **Risk:** Low - similar to primary workflow
- **Timeline:** 2 days

**Step 3.3: Create hotfix-task-flow.yaml (Day 8-9)**
- [ ] New workflow for expedited fixes
- [ ] Uses all 3 sub-workflows (git, implementation, review-failure)
- [ ] Minimal planning (fast-track approach)
- [ ] Expedited review process
- [ ] ~80 lines total
- [ ] Test with hotfix scenario
- **Risk:** Low - composition of existing patterns
- **Timeline:** 2 days

**Step 3.4: Delete Unused Workflows (Day 9)**
- [ ] Delete `/workflows/` directory entirely
- [ ] Delete 5 unused files from `/src/workflows/definitions/`
- [ ] Update WorkflowCoordinator if needed (remove references)
- [ ] Update documentation
- **Risk:** Very Low - already confirmed unused
- **Timeline:** 1 day

**Step 3.5: Integration Testing (Day 10)**
- [ ] Test all workflow paths in development
- [ ] Verify workflow selection logic works
- [ ] Test all sub-workflow combinations
- [ ] Document workflow selection criteria
- **Risk:** Low - validation step
- **Timeline:** 1 day

**Deliverable:** Complete workflow architecture (5 core + 3 sub-workflows), ready for production

## Breaking Changes

### None for End Users
- Task creation API unchanged
- Workflow behavior unchanged (100% feature parity)
- Output formats unchanged
- Dashboard interactions unchanged

### For Workflow Developers
1. **Sub-workflow references**
   - Old: `type: QAFailureCoordinationStep`
   - New: `type: SubWorkflowStep, workflow: "review-failure-handling"`
   - Migration: Automated script can convert most references

2. **PM prompts**
   - Old: Embedded in YAML (200+ line strings)
   - New: External template file (`prompts/pm-review-prioritization.txt`)
   - Migration: Extract prompts to files, replace with `prompt_template` reference

3. **Workflow versioning**
   - Introduce `version` field in workflow YAML
   - Old workflows without version treated as v1.0.0
   - New workflows must specify version

### For Testing
1. **Sub-workflow mocking**
   - Can mock sub-workflows in tests (faster, more isolated)
   - Can test sub-workflows independently
   - Can test parent workflow without executing sub-workflows

2. **Workflow fixtures**
   - Some test fixtures may need updates for new structure
   - Bulk task creation requires mock API endpoint
   - PM prompt externalization changes test setup

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Git Revert (Primary Method)
- **If:** Critical issues after deployment
- **Action:** `git revert <commit>` to restore old workflow files
- **Time:** ~5 minutes (includes redeploy)
- **Impact:** Reverts to pre-sub-workflow state
- **Risk:** Low - clean git history, tested approach

### Partial Rollback (Per-Step)
- **If:** One sub-workflow has issues, others work
- **Action:** 
  1. Inline problematic sub-workflow steps back into main workflow
  2. Deploy fix
  3. Debug sub-workflow offline
- **Time:** ~15 minutes
- **Impact:** Isolated to affected pattern
- **Risk:** Low - can mix inline and sub-workflow approaches

### Emergency Hotfix
- **If:** Unable to revert cleanly
- **Action:**
  1. Restore specific workflow file from git history
  2. Disable problematic step types temporarily
  3. Deploy minimal working version
- **Time:** ~10 minutes
- **Impact:** May lose some sub-workflow benefits temporarily
- **Risk:** Medium - requires manual intervention

### Data Rollback
- **Not Needed:** No database schema changes
- **Not Needed:** No task data format changes
- **Not Needed:** No milestone changes
- Sub-workflows only change execution flow, not data

**Note:** No feature flags needed per user preference (fall-forward approach)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
**None identified**

### Medium Risk Items

1. **SubWorkflowStep Implementation**
   - **Risk:** New step type could have bugs
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive unit tests, isolated integration tests
   - **Rollback:** Feature flag instant rollback
   - **Likelihood:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High (blocks all sub-workflow usage)
   - **Detection:** Integration tests will catch before production

2. **Bulk Task Creation**
   - **Risk:** Dashboard API bulk endpoint may have edge cases
   - **Mitigation:** Can fall back to sequential creation if bulk fails
   - **Rollback:** Graceful degradation in BulkTaskCreationStep
   - **Likelihood:** Low (dashboard API change, not workflow)
   - **Impact:** Medium (slower but still works)
   - **Detection:** Performance monitoring, error logs

3. **PM Prompt Externalization**
   - **Risk:** Template rendering could fail or produce different output
   - **Mitigation:** Compare v1 vs v2 PM prompts in tests
   - **Rollback:** Can inline prompts temporarily
   - **Likelihood:** Low (simple template substitution)
   - **Impact:** Medium (affects review failure decisions)
   - **Detection:** PM response parsing tests

### Low Risk Items

1. **Git Operations Sub-Workflow**
   - Just refactoring existing GitOperationStep calls
   - No new logic, pure reorganization
   - Extensive existing tests cover git operations

2. **Task Implementation Sub-Workflow**
   - Combines existing steps (context, planning, implementation)
   - No new behavior, just composition
   - Well-tested individual steps

3. **Workflow File Cleanup**
   - Deleting unused files has no runtime impact
   - WorkflowEngine already ignores /workflows directory
   - Archive preserves files for reference

## Open Questions for User Review

### 1. Workflow Naming ‚úÖ APPROVED
**Question:** Should we rename `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` to something clearer?

**Options:**
  - Option A: Keep current name `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml`
  - Option B: Rename to `standard-task-flow.yaml`
  - **Option C: Rename to `task-flow.yaml` ‚úÖ SELECTED**

**User Decision:** "for naming i prefer Option C - task-flow"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Rename `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` ‚Üí `task-flow.yaml`
- ‚úÖ Update WorkflowCoordinator references
- ‚úÖ Update documentation
- ‚úÖ Update any tests that reference the workflow name

**Benefits:**
- Simplest, most generic name
- Removes "legacy" confusion
- Clear primary workflow designation

### 2. Archive vs Delete ‚úÖ APPROVED
**Decision:** Delete unused workflows entirely

**User Response:** "delete unused"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Delete `/workflows/` directory entirely (3 files: feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml)
- ‚úÖ Delete from `/src/workflows/definitions/`: 
  - code-review-followup.yaml
  - qa-iteration.yaml  
  - security-hardening.yaml
  - feature.yaml (duplicate)
  - hotfix.yaml (duplicate)
- ‚úÖ Keep backup in git history (can recover if needed)
- ‚ùå No archive directory needed

### 3. Feature Flag Duration ‚úÖ APPROVED - NO FEATURE FLAGS
**Decision:** Fall-forward approach, no feature flags needed

**User Response:** "no need for feature flags - fall forward approach"

**Revised Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ Direct replacement of workflow files (no v1/v2 parallel)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing in development before deployment
- ‚úÖ Deploy sub-workflows + refactored workflows together
- ‚úÖ Rollback via git revert if critical issues found
- ‚ùå No feature flag configuration
- ‚ùå No canary rollout complexity

**Benefits:**
- Simpler implementation (no conditional logic)
- Faster deployment (no gradual rollout)
- Cleaner codebase (no feature flag code)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing in dev environment before production
- Deploy during low-activity period
- Monitor closely for first 24 hours
- Git revert ready if needed (~5 min rollback)

### 4. Sub-Workflow Versioning ‚úÖ CLARIFIED
**Question Clarification:** Do individual sub-workflow YAML files need version fields?

**User Response:** "not sure what this question is for. versions are captured at the milestone branch level. completed milestones should create versioned merges"

**Understanding:**
- Workflow versioning is NOT needed (milestone branches handle versioning)
- Sub-workflows are implementation details, not release artifacts
- Git history + milestone branches provide sufficient version control

**Decision:**
- ‚ùå No version fields in sub-workflow YAML files
- ‚úÖ Rely on git commits + milestone branches for versioning
- ‚úÖ Sub-workflows evolve with codebase (backward compatibility maintained)

### 5. Conditional Workflow Migration ‚úÖ APPROVED - DO NOW
**Decision:** Migrate ALL workflows now (complete consolidation)

**User Response:** "i want complete workflow consolidation now to clarify the intent of the architecture for the dashboard redesign and test rationalization"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Migrate primary workflow (legacy-compatible-task-flow)
- ‚úÖ Migrate conditional workflows (in-review-task-flow, blocked-task-resolution)
- ‚úÖ Create hotfix-task-flow
- ‚úÖ Complete consolidation before dashboard API design

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Sub-workflows + primary workflow
- Week 2: Conditional workflows + hotfix workflow + cleanup
- Total: 2 weeks for complete workflow architecture

**Benefits:**
- Complete workflow architecture informs dashboard API design
- Clear patterns for test rationalization
- Single consolidated effort (no revisiting later)
- All workflows use same sub-workflow patterns

- Phase 2 Dashboard backend proof: Nov 30 - Dec 6 (Week 6)
- Phase 3 Test rationalization: Dec 7-20 (Week 7-8) - informed by complete workflow patterns

**Critical Path Updated:**
Workflow consolidation FIRST ‚Üí then dashboard API design ‚Üí then test rationalization

This ensures:
1. Complete workflow patterns inform dashboard API requirements
2. Complete workflow architecture informs test business logic mapping
3. Single consolidated effort (no revisiting workflows)
4. Clear architectural intent for all downstream work
