# Workflow Rationalization Proposal
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Day 4  
**Status:** Ready for Review

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Consolidate 12 workflows into 5 core workflows + 3 sub-workflows

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Remove 8 unused/duplicate workflows
- ‚úÖ Reduce main workflow by 55% (446 ‚Üí 200 lines)
- ‚úÖ Eliminate 67% of maintenance burden (3 implementations ‚Üí 1)
- ‚úÖ 10-100x faster task creation (bulk API)
- ‚úÖ Clear migration path with zero downtime

**Timeline:** 2 weeks implementation after approval

## Current State Assessment

### Workflow Inventory

| Location | File | Lines | Status | Usage |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| `/workflows` | feature.yml | 108 | ‚ùå Unused | Not loaded by WorkflowEngine |
| `/workflows` | hotfix.yml | 62 | ‚ùå Unused | Not loaded by WorkflowEngine |
| `/workflows` | project-loop.yml | 87 | ‚ùå Unused | Not loaded by WorkflowEngine |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml | 446 | ‚úÖ Active | **Primary (95%+)** |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | project-loop.yaml | 87 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fallback | Rarely used |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | in-review-task-flow.yaml | 195 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional | <1% usage |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | blocked-task-resolution.yaml | 215 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional | <1% usage |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | feature.yaml | 108 | ‚ùå Duplicate | Copy of /workflows/feature.yml |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | hotfix.yaml | 62 | ‚ùå Duplicate | Copy of /workflows/hotfix.yml |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | code-review-followup.yaml | ~150 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Not referenced |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | qa-iteration.yaml | ~100 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Not referenced |
| `/src/workflows/definitions` | security-hardening.yaml | ~120 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unused | Not referenced |

**Total:** 12 workflows, ~1,840 lines  
**Active:** 1 primary + 3 conditional = 4 workflows  
**Unused:** 8 workflows (43% of total)

### Problem Analysis

**1. Duplication Across Files**
- `/workflows` vs `/src/workflows/definitions` - same files, different locations
- WorkflowEngine only loads from `/src/workflows/definitions`
- 3 files completely ignored (feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml in /workflows)

**2. Duplication Within Files**
- Review failure handling: 530 lines across 3 implementations
- Git operations: Repeated in multiple workflows
- Task status updates: Copy-paste pattern everywhere

**3. Monolithic Workflows**
- `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml`: 446 lines, 30 steps, does everything
- No reusable components
- Hard to test, debug, or modify

**4. Unused Workflows**
- 8 workflows never referenced in production
- Unclear which are intentional vs abandoned
- No deprecation markers or documentation

**5. Workflow Selection Confusion**
- WorkflowCoordinator tries: legacy-compatible ‚Üí findWorkflowByCondition ‚Üí project-loop
- `findWorkflowByCondition` rarely matches
- 95%+ tasks use legacy-compatible-task-flow

---

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Workflows (5)

1. **legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml** (v2.0) - Primary workflow
   - 446 ‚Üí 200 lines (55% reduction)
   - Uses sub-workflows for common patterns
   - Handles: git setup ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí reviews ‚Üí completion

2. **project-loop.yaml** - Fallback workflow
   - Keep as-is (87 lines)
   - Used when legacy-compatible not applicable
   - Minimal changes needed

3. **in-review-task-flow.yaml** - Conditional workflow
   - Refactor to use review-failure-handling sub-workflow
   - Reduce from 195 ‚Üí ~100 lines
   - Used for tasks already in review status

4. **blocked-task-resolution.yaml** - Conditional workflow
   - Refactor to use task-implementation sub-workflow
   - Reduce from 215 ‚Üí ~120 lines
   - Used for unblocking tasks

5. **hotfix-task-flow.yaml** (NEW) - Fast-track workflow
   - Merge hotfix.yaml concepts with sub-workflows
   - Minimal planning, fast implementation, expedited review
   - ~80 lines

### Sub-Workflows (3)

1. **review-failure-handling.yaml** (NEW) ‚≠ê Priority 1
   - Unified review failure coordination
   - 50 lines, replaces 530 lines
   - Used by: legacy-compatible, in-review-task-flow, hotfix-task-flow

2. **task-implementation.yaml** (NEW) üîß Priority 2
   - Reusable planning + implementation
   - ~60 lines
   - Used by: legacy-compatible, blocked-task-resolution, hotfix-task-flow

3. **git-operations.yaml** (NEW) üåø Priority 3
   - Standard git setup pattern
   - ~30 lines
   - Used by: all workflows

### Archived/Deleted (8)

**Archive** (move to `/src/workflows/archive/`):
- `code-review-followup.yaml` - Unused, replaced by review-failure-handling
- `qa-iteration.yaml` - Unused, logic in QAIterationLoopStep
- `security-hardening.yaml` - Unused, unclear intent
- `feature.yaml` - Duplicate of /workflows/feature.yml
- `hotfix.yaml` - Duplicate, merged into hotfix-task-flow

**Delete** (remove entirely):
- `/workflows/feature.yml` - Not loaded, outdated
- `/workflows/hotfix.yml` - Not loaded, outdated
- `/workflows/project-loop.yml` - Not loaded, duplicate of definitions version

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Implement Sub-Workflows (Week 1)
**Goal:** Create reusable sub-workflow components

**Step 1.1: Implement SubWorkflowStep (Day 1-2)**
- [ ] Create `SubWorkflowStep.ts` in `src/workflows/steps/`
- [ ] Implement sub-workflow loading from `sub-workflows/` directory
- [ ] Implement input validation against schema
- [ ] Implement isolated execution context
- [ ] Implement output mapping back to parent
- [ ] Add unit tests for SubWorkflowStep
- **Risk:** Medium - New step type, needs thorough testing
- **Mitigation:** Test in isolation before workflow integration

**Step 1.2: Implement Support Steps (Day 2-3)**
- [ ] `BulkTaskCreationStep.ts` - Bulk dashboard API calls
- [ ] `PMDecisionParserStep.ts` - Normalize PM decisions
- [ ] `ConditionalStep.ts` - Conditional execution logic
- [ ] `VariableResolutionStep.ts` - Variable resolution
- [ ] Unit tests for each step type
- **Risk:** Low - Simple step implementations
- **Dependencies:** Dashboard bulk endpoint (can mock for now)

**Step 1.3: Create Sub-Workflow Files (Day 3-4)**
- [ ] `src/workflows/sub-workflows/review-failure-handling.yaml`
- [ ] `src/workflows/sub-workflows/task-implementation.yaml`
- [ ] `src/workflows/sub-workflows/git-operations.yaml`
- [ ] Create `prompts/pm-review-prioritization.txt`
- [ ] Validate YAML syntax and schema
- **Risk:** Low - Pure YAML, no code changes
- **Testing:** Can validate offline before integration

**Step 1.4: Integration Tests (Day 4-5)**
- [ ] Test sub-workflow execution in isolation
- [ ] Test parent ‚Üí sub-workflow ‚Üí parent data flow
- [ ] Test error handling and rollback
- [ ] Test with mock dashboard API
- **Risk:** Medium - Complex integration scenarios
- **Mitigation:** Start with git-operations (simplest), then task-implementation, then review-failure-handling

**Deliverable:** Working sub-workflow system, ready for workflow migration

---

### Phase 2: Migrate legacy-compatible-task-flow (Week 2)
**Goal:** Refactor primary workflow to use sub-workflows

**Revised Strategy (No Feature Flags):**

**Step 2.1: Development Testing (Day 1-2)**
- [ ] Create refactored workflow in development branch
- [ ] Replace review failure steps with sub-workflow calls
- [ ] Replace implementation steps with task-implementation sub-workflow
- [ ] Replace git steps with git-operations sub-workflow
- [ ] Run full test suite in development
- [ ] Manual testing of all review paths (QA, code, security)
- **Risk:** Medium - Need comprehensive testing
- **Success Criteria:** All tests pass, manual testing successful

**Step 2.2: Integration Testing (Day 2-3)**
- [ ] Deploy to staging/test environment
- [ ] Run against real Redis streams (test data)
- [ ] Test all persona interactions
- [ ] Test all review failure scenarios
- [ ] Verify bulk task creation works
- [ ] Compare outputs with production behavior
- **Risk:** Medium - Need environment parity
- **Success Criteria:** 100% feature parity with production

**Step 2.3: Production Deployment (Day 3-4)**
- [ ] Schedule deployment during low-activity period
- [ ] Deploy sub-workflows first (unused initially, safe)
- [ ] Deploy refactored workflow + new step types
- [ ] Monitor first 10 tasks closely
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- **Risk:** Medium - Direct production deployment
- **Mitigation:** Deploy during low activity, close monitoring
- **Rollback:** Git revert ready (~5 min)

**Step 2.4: Monitoring & Validation (Day 4-5)**
- [ ] Compare metrics: task timing, success rate, API calls
- [ ] Verify bulk task creation working (fewer dashboard calls)
- [ ] Check for any error patterns
- [ ] Validate PM decisions match previous behavior
- [ ] Confirm all review types working
- **Risk:** Low - Just monitoring
- **Success Criteria:** Metrics match or improve vs baseline

**Deliverable:** Primary workflow using sub-workflows, 55% smaller, 100% feature parity

---

### Phase 3: Migrate Other Workflows (DEFERRED per user decision)
**Goal:** Apply sub-workflow pattern to conditional workflows

**User Decision:** Defer until after dashboard redesign complete

This phase moved to post-Phase 7 (after complete dashboard backend):
- Refactor in-review-task-flow.yaml (195 ‚Üí ~100 lines)
- Refactor blocked-task-resolution.yaml (215 ‚Üí ~120 lines)  
- Create hotfix-task-flow.yaml (~80 lines)
- Timeline: 1 week after dashboard complete

**Rationale:**
- Conditional workflows rarely used (<1% of tasks)
- Focus on critical path (dashboard redesign)
- Can apply dashboard learnings when implementing later

## Breaking Changes

### None for End Users
- Task creation API unchanged
- Workflow behavior unchanged (100% feature parity)
- Output formats unchanged
- Dashboard interactions unchanged

### For Workflow Developers
1. **Sub-workflow references**
   - Old: `type: QAFailureCoordinationStep`
   - New: `type: SubWorkflowStep, workflow: "review-failure-handling"`
   - Migration: Automated script can convert most references

2. **PM prompts**
   - Old: Embedded in YAML (200+ line strings)
   - New: External template file (`prompts/pm-review-prioritization.txt`)
   - Migration: Extract prompts to files, replace with `prompt_template` reference

3. **Workflow versioning**
   - Introduce `version` field in workflow YAML
   - Old workflows without version treated as v1.0.0
   - New workflows must specify version

### For Testing
1. **Sub-workflow mocking**
   - Can mock sub-workflows in tests (faster, more isolated)
   - Can test sub-workflows independently
   - Can test parent workflow without executing sub-workflows

2. **Workflow fixtures**
   - Some test fixtures may need updates for new structure
   - Bulk task creation requires mock API endpoint
   - PM prompt externalization changes test setup

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Git Revert (Primary Method)
- **If:** Critical issues after deployment
- **Action:** `git revert <commit>` to restore old workflow files
- **Time:** ~5 minutes (includes redeploy)
- **Impact:** Reverts to pre-sub-workflow state
- **Risk:** Low - clean git history, tested approach

### Partial Rollback (Per-Step)
- **If:** One sub-workflow has issues, others work
- **Action:** 
  1. Inline problematic sub-workflow steps back into main workflow
  2. Deploy fix
  3. Debug sub-workflow offline
- **Time:** ~15 minutes
- **Impact:** Isolated to affected pattern
- **Risk:** Low - can mix inline and sub-workflow approaches

### Emergency Hotfix
- **If:** Unable to revert cleanly
- **Action:**
  1. Restore specific workflow file from git history
  2. Disable problematic step types temporarily
  3. Deploy minimal working version
- **Time:** ~10 minutes
- **Impact:** May lose some sub-workflow benefits temporarily
- **Risk:** Medium - requires manual intervention

### Data Rollback
- **Not Needed:** No database schema changes
- **Not Needed:** No task data format changes
- **Not Needed:** No milestone changes
- Sub-workflows only change execution flow, not data

**Note:** No feature flags needed per user preference (fall-forward approach)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
**None identified**

### Medium Risk Items

1. **SubWorkflowStep Implementation**
   - **Risk:** New step type could have bugs
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive unit tests, isolated integration tests
   - **Rollback:** Feature flag instant rollback
   - **Likelihood:** Medium
   - **Impact:** High (blocks all sub-workflow usage)
   - **Detection:** Integration tests will catch before production

2. **Bulk Task Creation**
   - **Risk:** Dashboard API bulk endpoint may have edge cases
   - **Mitigation:** Can fall back to sequential creation if bulk fails
   - **Rollback:** Graceful degradation in BulkTaskCreationStep
   - **Likelihood:** Low (dashboard API change, not workflow)
   - **Impact:** Medium (slower but still works)
   - **Detection:** Performance monitoring, error logs

3. **PM Prompt Externalization**
   - **Risk:** Template rendering could fail or produce different output
   - **Mitigation:** Compare v1 vs v2 PM prompts in tests
   - **Rollback:** Can inline prompts temporarily
   - **Likelihood:** Low (simple template substitution)
   - **Impact:** Medium (affects review failure decisions)
   - **Detection:** PM response parsing tests

### Low Risk Items

1. **Git Operations Sub-Workflow**
   - Just refactoring existing GitOperationStep calls
   - No new logic, pure reorganization
   - Extensive existing tests cover git operations

2. **Task Implementation Sub-Workflow**
   - Combines existing steps (context, planning, implementation)
   - No new behavior, just composition
   - Well-tested individual steps

3. **Workflow File Cleanup**
   - Deleting unused files has no runtime impact
   - WorkflowEngine already ignores /workflows directory
   - Archive preserves files for reference

---

## Open Questions for User Review

### 1. Workflow Naming ‚úÖ ANSWERED
**Question:** Should we rename `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` to something clearer?

**Options:**
  - **Option A:** Keep current name `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` (no changes needed)
  - **Option B:** Rename to `standard-task-flow.yaml` (removes "legacy" confusion)
  - **Option C:** Rename to `task-flow.yaml` (simplest)

**User Decision Needed:** Please specify preferred name or confirm keep current name

### 2. Archive vs Delete ‚úÖ APPROVED
**Decision:** Delete unused workflows entirely

**User Response:** "delete unused"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Delete `/workflows/` directory entirely (3 files: feature.yml, hotfix.yml, project-loop.yml)
- ‚úÖ Delete from `/src/workflows/definitions/`: 
  - code-review-followup.yaml
  - qa-iteration.yaml  
  - security-hardening.yaml
  - feature.yaml (duplicate)
  - hotfix.yaml (duplicate)
- ‚úÖ Keep backup in git history (can recover if needed)
- ‚ùå No archive directory needed

### 3. Feature Flag Duration ‚úÖ APPROVED - NO FEATURE FLAGS
**Decision:** Fall-forward approach, no feature flags needed

**User Response:** "no need for feature flags - fall forward approach"

**Revised Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ Direct replacement of workflow files (no v1/v2 parallel)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing in development before deployment
- ‚úÖ Deploy sub-workflows + refactored workflows together
- ‚úÖ Rollback via git revert if critical issues found
- ‚ùå No feature flag configuration
- ‚ùå No canary rollout complexity

**Benefits:**
- Simpler implementation (no conditional logic)
- Faster deployment (no gradual rollout)
- Cleaner codebase (no feature flag code)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing in dev environment before production
- Deploy during low-activity period
- Monitor closely for first 24 hours
- Git revert ready if needed (~5 min rollback)

### 4. Sub-Workflow Versioning ‚úÖ CLARIFIED
**Question Clarification:** Do individual sub-workflow YAML files need version fields?

**User Response:** "not sure what this question is for. versions are captured at the milestone branch level. completed milestones should create versioned merges"

**Understanding:**
- Workflow versioning is NOT needed (milestone branches handle versioning)
- Sub-workflows are implementation details, not release artifacts
- Git history + milestone branches provide sufficient version control

**Decision:**
- ‚ùå No version fields in sub-workflow YAML files
- ‚úÖ Rely on git commits + milestone branches for versioning
- ‚úÖ Sub-workflows evolve with codebase (backward compatibility maintained)

### 5. Phase 3 Priority ‚úÖ APPROVED - DEFER
**Decision:** Defer Phase 3 until after dashboard redesign

**User Response:** "Phase can be deferred until after dashboard redesign"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Focus on primary workflow only (legacy-compatible-task-flow)
- ‚úÖ Defer conditional workflow refactoring (in-review-task-flow, blocked-task-resolution)
- ‚úÖ Defer hotfix-task-flow creation
- ‚úÖ Phase 3 becomes post-dashboard cleanup task

**Revised Timeline:**
- Phase 0-2: Workflow rationalization (primary workflow only)
- Phase 1-7: Dashboard redesign (API, backend, test rationalization, review consolidation)
- Phase 3 (deferred): Migrate conditional workflows after dashboard complete

**Benefits:**
- Faster path to dashboard work (critical path)
- Conditional workflows rarely used (<1% of tasks)
- Can apply dashboard learnings to Phase 3 later
