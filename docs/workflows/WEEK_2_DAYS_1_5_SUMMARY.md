## Day-by-Day Accomplishments

### Day 1: DevOps Review Handling ✅

**Commit:** f3c251b  
**Files:** 2 changed, 54 insertions(+), 14 deletions(-)

**Changes:**
- Added `handle_devops_failure` SubWorkflowStep to task-flow.yaml
- DevOps review uses unified review-failure-handling pattern
- Priority: 1100 (between QA=1200 and Code=1000)
- Updated REFACTOR_TRACKER with Week 1 achievements

**Result:** All 4 review types (QA, Code, Security, DevOps) now unified

---

### Day 2: Delete Unused Workflows ✅

**Commit:** 5f76ad5  
**Files:** 8 changed, 1,994 deletions(-)

**Deleted Files:**
- `/workflows/` directory (3 files):
  - feature.yml (108 lines)
  - hotfix.yml (62 lines)
  - project-loop.yml (87 lines)

- `/src/workflows/definitions/` (5 files):
  - feature.yaml (108 lines, duplicate)
  - hotfix.yaml (62 lines, duplicate)
  - qa-followup.yaml (~150 lines, unused)
  - code-implementation-workflow.yaml (~200 lines, unused)
  - context-only.yaml (~120 lines, unused)

**Result:** 1,994 lines of unused code removed, cleaner codebase

---

### Days 3-4: Conditional Workflow Migration ✅

**Commit:** 6cfc9b3  
**Files:** 2 changed, 107 insertions(+), 169 deletions(-)

#### in-review-task-flow.yaml v2.0.0

**Before:** 266 lines with inline PM evaluation  
**After:** 178 lines using review-failure-handling sub-workflow  
**Reduction:** 88 lines (33%)

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced inline PM evaluation + ReviewFailureTasksStep with SubWorkflowStep
- All 3 reviews (Code, Security, DevOps) use unified pattern
- Added TDD awareness (tdd_aware, tdd_stage)
- Added duplicate detection support (existing_tasks)
- Consistent with task-flow.yaml v3.0.0

#### blocked-task-resolution.yaml v2.0.0

**Before:** 169 lines without TDD awareness  
**After:** 193 lines with TDD context  
**Change:** +24 lines (TDD additions)

**Key Changes:**
- Added TDD variables (tdd_aware, tdd_stage)
- Lead engineer receives TDD context
- Warns when in failing_test stage (expected failures)
- Does NOT use review-failure-handling (unblocking is domain-specific)

**Result:** All conditional workflows aligned with unified pattern

---

### Day 5: Hotfix Workflow Creation ✅

**Commit:** ee28261  
**Files:** 1 changed, 258 insertions(+)

**Created:** hotfix-task-flow.yaml v1.0.0 (258 lines)

**Key Features:**
- Fast-track workflow for emergency production hotfixes
- Abbreviated planning (2 iterations max vs 5)
- Critical reviews only (QA, Code, Security)
- DevOps review SKIPPED for speed
- Higher priority (2000 vs 1000-1500)
- All review failures block (no deferral)
- 8 steps (vs 13+ in task-flow.yaml) - 38% faster

**Trigger:**
```yaml
condition: "labels.includes('hotfix') || labels.includes('urgent') || labels.includes('emergency') || priority >= 2000"
```

**Result:** Emergency fix capability with maintained safety (critical reviews)

## Architecture Achievements

### 1. Unified Review Pattern ✅

All 4 review types now use review-failure-handling.yaml:
- QA review (priority 1200)
- Code review (priority 1000)
- Security review (priority 1500)
- DevOps review (priority 1100)

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for review logic
- PM evaluation centralized
- Duplicate detection at PM level + BulkTaskCreationStep
- TDD awareness across all reviews
- Easy to maintain (fix once, works everywhere)

### 2. TDD Awareness ✅

All workflows support TDD context:
- `tdd_aware` flag (boolean)
- `tdd_stage` (write_failing_test | failing_test | implementation | passing_test)
- PM receives TDD context warnings
- Lead engineer (blocked-resolution) knows when failures expected
- Prevents inappropriate task creation during TDD

### 3. Duplicate Detection ✅

Implemented at two levels:
- **PM evaluation:** Receives existing_tasks list, can mark duplicates
- **BulkTaskCreationStep:** Filters duplicates by title+milestone or external_id

(Note: existing_tasks query from dashboard is TODO for Phase 1)

### 4. Conditional Workflows ✅

- **in-review-task-flow.yaml:** Handles tasks already in review status
- **blocked-task-resolution.yaml:** Analyzes and unblocks stuck tasks
- Both use unified patterns where applicable

### 5. Emergency Response ✅

- **hotfix-task-flow.yaml:** Fast-track for critical production fixes
- 38% faster (8 steps vs 13+)
- Critical reviews maintained (QA, Code, Security)
- DevOps review skipped (handled separately)
- No deferral allowed (safety-first)

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. Why blocked-task-resolution Doesn't Use Sub-Workflows

**Decision:** Keep as standalone workflow with TDD additions

**Reasoning:**
- Domain-specific logic (unblock analysis is unique)
- No duplication with other workflows
- Uses specialized steps (BlockedTaskAnalysisStep, UnblockAttemptStep)
- Iteration tracking (attempt counts, max attempts)
- Validation required (QA validates unblock success)

**TDD awareness added for context, but core logic remains unique.**

### 2. Why Hotfix Skips DevOps Review

**Decision:** Skip DevOps review for speed

**Reasoning:**
- Time-critical emergency fixes
- Manual deployment by ops team
- DevOps can review post-deployment
- Critical reviews maintained (QA, Code, Security)

**Safety measures:**
- QA validates functionality
- Code review catches bugs
- Security review prevents vulnerabilities

### 3. Why Hotfix Has Higher Priority

**Decision:** Priority 2000 (vs 1000-1500 for normal reviews)

**Reasoning:**
- Emergency fixes must jump queue
- Production outages require immediate attention
- Higher than all review failure tasks
- Ensures rapid response

**Compilation:** ✅ All builds successful (npm run build clean after each commit)

**Remaining:**
- Manual smoke testing (Day 6)
- Integration testing (Day 6)
- Documentation review (Day 7)
