### Key Requirements

**1. Bulk Task Creation (NEW)**

- Fixes N+1 problem
- Duplicate detection (3 strategies)
- Performance: <100ms for 20 tasks

**2. Task Status Updates**
- Endpoint: `PATCH /projects/{id}/tasks/{taskId}`
- Used by all 6 workflows
- Performance: <10ms

**3. Query Existing Tasks**
- Endpoint: `GET /projects/{id}/tasks?filters`
- Milestone-scoped queries
- Status filtering
- Field selection
- Performance: <50ms for 100 tasks

**4. Milestone Operations**
- Get details: `GET /projects/{id}/milestones/{milestoneId}`
- Get tasks: `GET /projects/{id}/milestones/{milestoneId}/tasks?filters`
- Performance: <50ms

**5. Project Status**
- Endpoint: `GET /projects/{id}/status`
- Used by WorkflowCoordinator
- Performance: <100ms for 1000 tasks

**6. Duplicate Detection**
- Built into bulk task create
- 3 strategies: title, title+milestone, external_id
- Performance: <5ms per task

### Coverage Analysis

- **Task status update:** 100% (all 6 workflows)
- **Bulk task create:** 67% (4 of 6 workflows)
- **Query existing tasks:** 67% (4 of 6 workflows)
- **Milestone operations:** 100% (all workflows)
- **Project status:** 100% (WorkflowCoordinator requirement)

**Conclusion:** All operations required for production.

### Next Steps

- **Day 2-3:** API Design Workshop (OpenAPI spec)
- **Day 4:** SQLite schema design
- **Day 5:** Documentation + USER CHECKPOINT #2

## Key Achievements

### Architectural

1. ✅ **Unified Review Pattern** - All 4 review types use same sub-workflow
2. ✅ **TDD Awareness** - All workflows understand test-driven development context
3. ✅ **Duplicate Detection** - PM + BulkTaskCreationStep prevent duplicate tasks
4. ✅ **Emergency Response** - Hotfix workflow for critical production fixes
5. ✅ **Code Reduction** - 1,758 lines removed (73% cleanup)

### Process

1. ✅ **Workflow Consolidation** - 12 workflows → 6 workflows (50% reduction)
2. ✅ **Sub-Workflow System** - Reusable patterns across all workflows
3. ✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive docs for all changes
4. ✅ **Clean Commits** - Concise commit messages per user guideline
5. ✅ **API Requirements** - Clear requirements from actual workflow usage

## Next Session Plan

### Option 1: Complete Week 2 (Days 6-7)
- Manual smoke testing of all workflows
- Documentation updates
- Production deployment preparation
- USER CHECKPOINT #1

### Option 2: Continue Phase 1 (Days 2-3)
- API Design Workshop
- Create OpenAPI specification
- Define all endpoints with request/response schemas
- Error handling strategy

### Option 3: Both (Parallel Work)
- Week 2 testing can be done independently
- Phase 1 API design can proceed in parallel
- Both tracks merge at checkpoints

**Recommended:** Option 2 (Continue Phase 1) - API design is non-blocking and provides value for Week 2 testing.

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Week 2 Testing:** Should we complete testing before proceeding to Phase 1, or continue in parallel?
2. **USER CHECKPOINT #1:** Do you want to review workflow consolidation before API design continues?
3. **API Design Scope:** Should we design full OpenAPI spec (Days 2-3) or proceed directly to schema design (Day 4)?
4. **Dashboard Backend:** When should we start the proof-of-concept implementation (Phase 2)?
