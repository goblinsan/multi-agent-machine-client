# Code and Security Review Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Persona Prompts (src/personas.ts)

#### Code-Reviewer Persona
**Before:** Basic prompt asking for JSON with status/details/issues

**After:** Comprehensive prompt that:
- Checks for code best practices (SRP, DRY, repeated code)
- Identifies maintainability issues (large files >500 lines, long methods >100 lines)
- Detects compile/syntax issues
- Finds organization problems
- Reports lint violations
- Returns severity-rated findings (SEVERE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Uses status="fail" when SEVERE or HIGH findings exist

#### Security-Review Persona
**Before:** Basic prompt asking for JSON with status/details/issues

**After:** Comprehensive prompt that:
- Checks for vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth bypass, etc.)
- Performs secrets scanning
- Validates license policy compliance
- Updates threat modeling
- Checks secure defaults
- Returns severity-rated findings (SEVERE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Uses status="fail" when SEVERE or HIGH findings exist

### 2. Review Log Functions (src/process.ts)

Added three new helper functions modeled after `writeQALog()` and `writePlanningLog()`:

#### `writeCodeReviewLog()`
- Creates `.ma/reviews/` directory
- Parses code review JSON response to extract severity-organized findings
- Writes structured log with:
  - Summary
  - Findings by severity (SEVERE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Full response
- Commits and pushes to repo with message: `code-review: {STATUS} for task {ID} (severe:X, high:Y)`

#### `writeSecurityReviewLog()`
- Creates `.ma/reviews/` directory  
- Parses security review JSON response to extract severity-organized findings
- Writes structured log with:
  - Summary
  - Security findings by severity (SEVERE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Full response
- Commits and pushes to repo with message: `security-review: {STATUS} for task {ID} (severe:X, high:Y)`

#### Integration Points
Both `processContext()` and `processPersona()` now call:
- `writeCodeReviewLog()` when persona === CODE_REVIEWER
- `writeSecurityReviewLog()` when persona === SECURITY_REVIEW

### 3. Workflow PM Prioritization Updates

Updated two workflow files with enhanced PM context:

#### legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml
- `pm_prioritize_code_review_failures` step:
  - Explains severity levels (SEVERE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Provides decision framework based on severity + project stage
  - Instructs PM to ALWAYS require immediate fix for SEVERE/HIGH
  - Allows deferring MEDIUM/LOW based on stage and completion %
  - Requires structured JSON response with immediate_issues, deferred_issues, follow_up_tasks

- `pm_prioritize_security_failures` step:
  - Explains security severity levels
  - Provides stage detection guidance (early/beta/production)
  - Stage-aware decision framework (SEVERE always immediate, HIGH stage-dependent, etc.)
  - Requires structured JSON response with detected_stage, immediate_issues, deferred_issues

#### in-review-task-flow.yaml
- Same enhancements as above for both PM prioritization steps
- Ensures consistent behavior when resuming in-review tasks

### 4. Documentation

Created `docs/REVIEW_SYSTEM_WITH_SEVERITY.md` with:
- Complete severity level definitions for code and security reviews
- What each review type checks for
- JSON response format specifications
- Review log storage structure
- PM decision framework with matrix
- Stage detection logic
- Workflow integration details
- Example scenarios (MVP, production, beta)
- Benefits and future enhancements

## Key Benefits

### 1. Status Reflects Actual Findings
- Code/security review status is now `fail` when SEVERE or HIGH issues found
- Not just "scan completed" but "scan found blocking issues"

### 2. Severity-Based Findings
Code review checks:
- ✅ Code best practices (maintainability, SRP, DRY, repeated code)
- ✅ Compile issues
- ✅ Organization issues  
- ✅ Lint checks
- ✅ Large files and methods

Security review checks:
- ✅ Vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, auth, etc.)
- ✅ Secrets scanning
- ✅ License policy
- ✅ Threat modeling
- ✅ Secure defaults

All organized into: SEVERE, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

### 3. Results Stored in Repo
- `.ma/reviews/task-{id}-code-review.log`
- `.ma/reviews/task-{id}-security-review.log`
- Committed and pushed for distributed agent access
- PM can read findings from disk

### 4. Intelligent PM Decisions
PM can now:
- Defer LOW/MEDIUM issues to backlog (early-stage projects)
- Require immediate fix for SEVERE/HIGH issues (any stage)
- Make stage-aware decisions (MVP vs production)
- Create follow-up tasks for deferred items
- Prevent blocking development with minor style issues
- Ensure critical security vulnerabilities are never deferred

### 5. Stage-Aware Prioritization
**Early Stage (MVP/POC):**
- Immediate: SEVERE, HIGH
- Defer: MEDIUM (code quality), LOW

**Beta Stage:**
- Immediate: SEVERE, HIGH
- Conditional: MEDIUM (case-by-case)
- Defer: LOW

**Production Stage:**
- Immediate: SEVERE, HIGH, most MEDIUM
- Defer: Only LOW

### 6. Distributed Workflow Safety
- All reviews fetch latest code from remote
- All review results committed to repo
- PM on one machine can read results from reviewer on another
- Consistent across multi-machine deployments

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test code-reviewer with SEVERE findings**
   - Create syntax error in code
   - Verify status="fail" returned
   - Verify finding appears in SEVERE array
   - Verify log written to `.ma/reviews/`

2. **Test code-reviewer with only LOW findings**
   - Create minor style issue
   - Verify status="pass" returned
   - Verify finding appears in LOW array
   - Verify PM receives findings for potential deferral

3. **Test security-review with SEVERE vulnerability**
   - Add SQL injection vulnerability
   - Verify status="fail" returned
   - Verify PM decision is "immediate_fix"

4. **Test PM stage detection**
   - Run with milestone_name="MVP Development"
   - Verify detected_stage="early"
   - Run with milestone_name="Production Release v1.0"
   - Verify detected_stage="production"

5. **Test log storage and commit**
   - Run code review
   - Verify `.ma/reviews/task-{id}-code-review.log` exists
   - Verify file is committed with proper message
   - On different machine, fetch and verify log is accessible

6. **Test PM deferral workflow**
   - Create MEDIUM findings in early-stage project
   - Verify PM defers with follow_up_tasks
   - Verify workflow proceeds to next stage

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. The system is backward compatible:

- Old prompts still work (personas gracefully handle missing severity arrays)
- If JSON parsing fails, raw response is still logged
- Existing workflows continue to function
- New severity features are additive

## Files Modified

1. `src/personas.ts` - Enhanced code-reviewer and security-review prompts
2. `src/process.ts` - Added writeCodeReviewLog() and writeSecurityReviewLog() functions
3. `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` - Enhanced PM context
4. `src/workflows/definitions/in-review-task-flow.yaml` - Enhanced PM context
5. `docs/REVIEW_SYSTEM_WITH_SEVERITY.md` - New comprehensive documentation

## Files Created

- `.ma/reviews/` directory (auto-created by review log functions)
- `docs/REVIEW_SYSTEM_WITH_SEVERITY.md`
