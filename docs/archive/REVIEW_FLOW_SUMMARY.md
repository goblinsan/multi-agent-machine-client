# Review Flow Implementation - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Bug: Workflow Engine Dependency Resolution
**Problem:** Steps with conditions that evaluated to false (skipped steps) were not added to the `executedSteps` set, causing dependent steps to wait forever.

**Impact:** When QA passed on first try, `qa_iteration_loop` was skipped, and `mark_task_in_review` (which depended on it) could never execute. This blocked the entire review pipeline.

**Fix:** Modified `WorkflowEngine.executeSteps()` to add both successful AND skipped steps to `executedSteps`.

### Workflow Structure Issues
**Problems:**
1. `mark_task_in_review` incorrectly depended on `qa_iteration_loop` (which could be skipped)
2. Code review, security review, and devops ran in parallel instead of sequentially
3. No PM involvement for handling review failures
4. Task marked as "done" without ensuring security review passed

**Fix:** Complete restructure of review flow in `legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml`

## New Workflow Flow

```
QA Request
  └─ Pass → Mark Task In Review
              └─ Code Review Request
                  ├─ Pass → Security Request
                  │          ├─ Pass → DevOps Request → Mark Task Done
                  │          └─ Fail → PM Prioritize Security Failures
                  └─ Fail → PM Prioritize Code Review Failures
```

### Sequential Review Flow:
1. **QA Pass** → Task marked as "in review"
2. **Code Review** → Evaluates code quality
   - Pass: Proceed to security review
   - Fail: PM prioritizes issues (immediate fix or defer to future milestone)
3. **Security Review** → Evaluates security vulnerabilities
   - Pass: Proceed to devops review
   - Fail: PM prioritizes issues (immediate fix or defer to future milestone)
4. **DevOps Review** → Evaluates deployment concerns
5. **Mark Task Done** → Only when security review passes

## Key Features

### ✅ Proper Sequential Flow
- Reviews execute in order: code → security → devops
- Each review waits for previous review to pass
- Fail-fast: if code review fails, security review doesn't run

### ✅ PM Prioritization
- PM evaluates code review failures with intent: `prioritize_code_review_failures`
- PM evaluates security failures with intent: `prioritize_security_failures`
- PM can decide: immediate fix, defer to future milestone, or create follow-up tasks

### ✅ Explicit Status Tracking
- Each review step outputs status: `code_review_request_status`, `security_request_status`
- Task only marked "done" when security review passes
- Clear conditions prevent premature completion

### ✅ No Deadlocks
- Workflow engine now treats skipped steps as "executed"
- Dependencies resolve correctly even when conditional steps are skipped
- QA pass properly transitions to review stages

## Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `src/workflows/engine/WorkflowEngine.ts` | **BUG FIX** | Fixed dependency resolution for skipped steps |
| `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml` | **RESTRUCTURE** | Implemented sequential review flow with PM prioritization |
| `tests/workflowGating.test.ts` | **UPDATE** | Updated assertions for new workflow structure |
| `tests/reviewFlowValidation.test.ts` | **NEW** | Added 5 comprehensive validation tests |
| `docs/REVIEW_FLOW_FIX.md` | **NEW** | Detailed technical documentation |

## Test Results

**✅ All 200 tests pass** (5 new tests added)

### New Tests:
1. ✅ Validates complete review flow structure
2. ✅ Ensures QA iteration loop doesn't block mark_in_review
3. ✅ Validates sequential review flow
4. ✅ Validates PM prioritization steps exist
5. ✅ Validates no circular dependencies

## Agent Requirements

### Code Reviewer Persona
Must return explicit status in response:
```json
{
  "status": "pass"  // or "fail"
}
```

If fail, include detailed issues:
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"severity": "high", "description": "Memory leak in event handler"},
    {"severity": "medium", "description": "Missing error handling"}
  ]
}
```

### Security Reviewer Persona
Must return explicit status in response:
```json
{
  "status": "pass"  // or "fail"
}
```

If fail, include detailed vulnerabilities:
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {"severity": "critical", "description": "SQL injection vulnerability"},
    {"severity": "medium", "description": "Weak password hashing"}
  ]
}
```

### Project Manager Persona
New intents to handle:
- `prioritize_code_review_failures` - Evaluate code review issues
- `prioritize_security_failures` - Evaluate security vulnerabilities

Expected response:
```json
{
  "decision": "defer",  // or "immediate_fix"
  "reasoning": "Milestone in early stages, medium severity can wait",
  "follow_up_tasks": [
    {"title": "Fix memory leak", "priority": "high"}
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

The workflow now properly implements the review flow as requested:
- ✅ Tasks with QA pass move to "in review" status
- ✅ Code review evaluates quality
- ✅ Failed code reviews go to PM for prioritization
- ✅ Passed code reviews go to security review
- ✅ Failed security reviews go to PM for prioritization
- ✅ Passed security reviews continue to devops and mark task as done

**Ready for deployment and testing with real workflow runs!**
