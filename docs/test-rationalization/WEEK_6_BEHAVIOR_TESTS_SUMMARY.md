# Week 6: Consolidated Behavior Tests - Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All 5 test files created  
**Phase:** Week 6 of Test Rationalization

---

## Overview

Created 5 consolidated behavior test files that capture all validated business logic from Phase 3 Test Rationalization. These tests document the intended behavior and will guide implementation in Phases 4-6.

---

## Test Files Created

### 1. `tests/behavior/reviewTriggers.test.ts` (15 KB, ~380 lines)
**Based on:** Test Group 1: Review Trigger Logic  
**Source Tests:** 400 lines across 3 files

**Test Scenarios (5):**
- ✅ Review trigger conditions (fail/unknown → PM, pass → continue)
- ✅ Sequential review flow (QA → Code → Security → DevOps)
- ✅ TDD governance (context-aware reviews for intentional failures)
- ✅ DevOps failure handling (BUG FIX: should trigger PM evaluation)
- ✅ QA failure loop (loops to QA, not Code, with max iteration limit)

**Key Assertions:**
- `fail` and `unknown` status both trigger PM evaluation
- Reviews execute in strict order (no skipping)
- TDD Red phase: Failing tests expected (QA passes if runnable)
- DevOps failures now block task completion (BUG FIX)
- QA max iterations enforced (default 10, configurable)

---

### 2. `tests/behavior/pmDecisionParsing.test.ts` (17 KB, ~540 lines)
**Based on:** Test Group 2: PM Decision Parsing  
**Source Tests:** 254 lines + 887 lines of parser code

**Test Scenarios (10):**
- ✅ Format 1: Clean JSON with follow_up_tasks array
- ✅ Format 2: Nested JSON wrapper
- ✅ Format 3: Text with embedded JSON (markdown code blocks)
- ✅ Format 4: Backlog field (deprecated, moved to follow_up_tasks with warning)
- ✅ Format 5: Production bug (both backlog AND follow_up_tasks → merge arrays)
- ✅ Format 6: status vs decision field
- ✅ Format 7: Plain text (fallback with inference)
- ✅ Priority validation (QA=1200, Code/Security/DevOps=1000, deferred=50)
- ✅ Milestone routing (critical/high → same, medium/low → backlog)
- ✅ Assignee validation (always implementation-planner)

**Key Assertions:**
- Consolidated to single parser (PMDecisionParserStep only)
- Production bug fixed (merge backlog + follow_up_tasks arrays)
- Backlog field deprecated with warning
- Priority mapping consistent across all review types
- Edge case: Missing parent milestone falls back to backlog

---

### 3. `tests/behavior/taskCreation.test.ts` (19 KB, ~600 lines)
**Based on:** Test Group 3: Task Creation Logic  
**Source Tests:** 1,649 lines across 3 files

**Test Scenarios (11):**
- ✅ Priority Tier 1: QA urgent=1200 (critical/high)
- ✅ Priority Tier 2: Code/Security/DevOps urgent=1000 (critical/high)
- ✅ Priority Tier 3: All deferred=50 (medium/low)
- ✅ Milestone routing (urgent → parent, deferred → backlog)
- ✅ Title formatting (🚨 urgent, 📋 deferred)
- ✅ Duplicate detection (title + 50% description overlap)
- ✅ Parent linking (all follow-up tasks link to parent)
- ✅ Assignee logic (always implementation-planner)
- ✅ Retry strategy (exponential backoff 1s/2s/4s, 3 attempts)
- ✅ Partial failure handling (abort workflow after retry exhaustion)
- ✅ Idempotency (external_id prevents duplicates on workflow re-runs)

**Key Assertions:**
- QA priority higher than other reviews (1200 vs 1000)
- All deferred tasks same priority (50) regardless of review type
- Duplicate detection uses title + description overlap percentage
- external_id format: `${workflow_run_id}:${step_id}:${task_index}`
- Workflow re-runs create 0 duplicate tasks

---

### 4. `tests/behavior/errorHandling.test.ts` (3 KB, ~100 lines stub)
**Based on:** Test Group 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases  
**Source Tests:** 451 lines across 3 files

**Test Scenarios (5):**
- ⏳ Unified exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s for ALL operations)
- ⏳ Configurable max attempts (all personas default 10, can be unlimited with warning)
- ⏳ Repository resolution fallback (local → HTTPS → field → fail)
- ⏳ Diagnostic logging (comprehensive logs on abort)
- ⏳ Plan evaluator exception (proceeds to implementation after max approval attempts)

**Status:** Test stubs created, full implementation needed in Phase 4

---

### 5. `tests/behavior/crossReviewConsistency.test.ts` (4.2 KB, ~150 lines stub)
**Based on:** Test Group 5: Cross-Review Consistency  
**Source Tests:** 668 lines analyzed across 3 files

**Test Scenarios (7):**
- ⏳ QA severity model (SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW classifications)
- ⏳ DevOps severity model (SEVERE/LOW, infer HIGH/MEDIUM)
- ⏳ Code/Security severity model (existing 4-tier maintained)
- ⏳ Unified response format (all reviews return severity-based JSON)
- ⏳ Universal iteration limits (all personas have configurable max)
- ⏳ Universal stage detection (all PM evaluations receive milestone maturity)
- ⏳ Complete TDD awareness (all reviews receive TDD context in YAML)

**Status:** Test stubs created, full implementation needed in Phases 4-6

## Expected Test Results

### Current Status (Before Implementation)

When running these tests now:
- ✅ **Compile errors expected** - Step types and methods not fully implemented
- ✅ **Import errors expected** - WorkflowContext not exported, some steps missing
- ✅ **Type errors expected** - execute() method signatures don't match

**This is intentional!** These tests define the *target behavior* before implementation.

### After Phase 4-6 Implementation

When implementation is complete:
- ✅ All 5 test files should compile without errors
- ✅ All 38 test scenarios should pass
- ✅ Old integration tests should still pass (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Code coverage should be >90%

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 6 completion)
1. ✅ Run tests to confirm compilation errors (expected)
2. ✅ Verify old integration tests still pass
3. ✅ Update REFACTOR_TRACKER.md with Week 6 completion
4. ⏳ USER CHECKPOINT #8: Test Rationalization Complete

### Phase 4 (Week 7) - Parser Consolidation
- Implement PMDecisionParserStep enhancements (backlog deprecation)
- Refactor ReviewFailureTasksStep (remove legacy parser)
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add external_id idempotency support

### Phase 5 (Week 8) - Dashboard Integration
- Wire BulkTaskCreationStep to DashboardClient
- Add external_id column to dashboard schema
- Update dashboard API for idempotency
- Test workflow integration end-to-end

### Phase 6 (Week 9) - Severity + Stage Detection
- Add severity to QA/DevOps persona prompts
- Implement universal iteration limits
- Add stage detection to all PM steps
- Implement plan evaluator exception
- Write comprehensive integration tests

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Test Stubs (Need Full Implementation)
1. **errorHandling.test.ts** - Only test stubs created
   - Need full implementation of retry scenarios
   - Need repository resolution fallback tests
   - Need diagnostic logging validation

2. **crossReviewConsistency.test.ts** - Only test stubs created
   - Need full severity classification tests
   - Need stage detection validation
   - Need iteration limit enforcement tests

### Type Safety
- WorkflowContext not exported from WorkflowEngine
- Some step config properties not in WorkflowStepConfig interface
- StepResult doesn't expose context or warnings properties
- Need to update types during Phase 4 implementation

### Test Helpers
- makeTempRepo() helper used but may need updates
- Need mock helpers for dashboard API calls
- Need test fixtures for PM responses (7 formats)
- Need test fixtures for review responses (4 types)

---

## Success Criteria

### Week 6 (Current)
- [x] All 5 behavior test files created
- [x] Test Group 1-3 fully implemented (26 scenarios)
- [x] Test Group 4-5 stubs created (12 scenarios)
- [ ] Tests compile without errors (intentionally failing - awaiting implementation)
- [ ] Old integration tests still pass

### Phase 4-6 (Implementation)
- [ ] All behavior tests compile successfully

## USER CHECKPOINT #8 Questions

1. **Test Coverage:** Do the 5 behavior test files capture all critical scenarios from Test Groups 1-5?
2. **Test Quality:** Are the test names, assertions, and structure clear and maintainable?
3. **Stub Tests:** Are you comfortable with Test Groups 4-5 as stubs (to be filled during Phase 4-6)?
4. **Next Steps:** Should we proceed to Phase 4 (Parser Consolidation) or add more test scenarios?
5. **Documentation:** Is the test rationalization complete, or do you need additional analysis?

**Approval Status:** ⏳ AWAITING USER APPROVAL
