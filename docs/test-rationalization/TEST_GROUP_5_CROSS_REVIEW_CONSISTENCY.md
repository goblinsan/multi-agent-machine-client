# Test Group 5: Cross-Review Consistency Analysis

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Analysis Complete - Awaiting User Validation  
**Test Files Analyzed:** 3 files (668 lines total)

---

## Executive Summary

This test group validates **behavioral uniformity** across the four review types (QA, Code Review, Security Review, DevOps Review). The analysis reveals a **hybrid consistency model**:

- ✅ **Unified Workflow Pattern:** All reviews use identical failure handling (review-failure-handling sub-workflow)
- ✅ **Unified Status Logic:** All reviews use `fail || unknown` → PM evaluation trigger
- ✅ **Unified TDD Awareness:** All reviews receive TDD context (tdd_aware, tdd_stage)
- ⚠️ **Severity-Based Differentiation:** Code/Security use 4-tier severity (SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), QA uses binary pass/fail
- ⚠️ **Domain-Specific Response Formats:** Each review type has specialized JSON structure
- ❌ **QA Review Lacks Severity Levels:** QA doesn't categorize test failures by severity (unlike Code/Security)

**Critical Finding:** Test Group 5 reveals architectural **inconsistency in severity handling**:
- Code Review: Has SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity classification
- Security Review: Has SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity classification  
- DevOps Review: No severity system found (needs investigation)
- **QA Review: NO severity classification** (binary pass/fail only)

**Business Impact:**
- PM receives different quality of context from QA vs Code/Security (less granular)
- QA findings cannot be prioritized by severity (all test failures treated equally)
- Dashboard task creation cannot differentiate critical QA failures from minor ones

## Test Files Analyzed

### 1. `tests/severityReviewSystem.test.ts` (557 lines)

**Purpose:** Validates severity-based review system for Code and Security reviews

**Key Assertions:**
- Code-reviewer prompt includes SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW definitions ✅
- Security-review prompt includes SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW definitions ✅
- PM receives severity guidance in context ✅
- Review logs stored in `.ma/reviews/` directory ✅
- Status interpretation based on severity (fail when SEVERE or HIGH) ✅
- JSON response format with severity-organized findings ✅

**Behavioral Patterns Extracted:**

1. **Severity Classification (Code Review):**
   - SEVERE: Blocking issues (compile errors, critical bugs)
   - HIGH: Significant problems (major tech debt, performance issues)
   - MEDIUM: Code smells (minor violations, style issues)
   - LOW: Suggestions (refactoring opportunities)
   - **Status Logic:** `status="fail"` when SEVERE or HIGH findings exist

2. **Severity Classification (Security Review):**
   - SEVERE: Critical vulnerabilities (RCE, auth bypass, data exposure)
   - HIGH: Significant security risks (known CVEs, weak crypto)
   - MEDIUM: Security concerns (missing headers, outdated deps)
   - LOW: Security improvements (hardening opportunities)
   - **Status Logic:** `status="fail"` when SEVERE or HIGH findings exist

3. **PM Context Enhancement:**
   - PM receives severity level explanations
   - PM receives decision framework guidance (immediate fix vs defer)
   - PM receives milestone context (status, completion %)
   - PM receives stage detection guidance (MVP/POC vs Production)

4. **Stage-Aware Decision Logic:**
   - **Code Review:** SEVERE/HIGH always immediate, MEDIUM/LOW can defer
   - **Security Review:** SEVERE always immediate regardless of stage, HIGH depends on production readiness
   - PM context includes `detected_stage` (MVP/POC/beta/production)

5. **Response Format Requirements:**
   - All severity arrays required (even if empty [])
   - Summary field always required
   - Findings must include specific fields (file, issue, recommendation, etc.)

**QA Review Coverage:** ❌ **QA NOT TESTED** in this file (only Code and Security)

---

### 2. `tests/qaPlanIterationMax.test.ts` (52 lines)

**Purpose:** Validates QA follow-up plan iteration respects max retries

**Key Assertions:**
- QA failure triggers QAFailureCoordinationStep with internal plan revision cycles ✅
- Should respect max iterations for plan revision (safety guard) ✅
- Should create tasks and forward to planner even when max iterations exceeded ✅
- **Business outcome:** Workflow doesn't hang (20-iteration safety limit)

**Behavioral Patterns Extracted:**

1. **Iteration Loop Logic:**
   - QA failures trigger iterative planning loop
   - Max iterations enforced (safety guard against infinite loops)
   - Even on max iterations, tasks still created (partial success)

2. **Safety Mechanisms:**
   - 20-iteration hard limit (test safety)
   - Redis mocks prevent hanging
   - Dashboard mocks prevent HTTP blocking

**Critical Gap:** Test only validates **non-hanging behavior**, not:
- What max iterations should be (production value)
- Whether max iterations should differ by review type
- How to handle graceful degradation after max iterations

---

### 3. `tests/tddContextInReviewers.test.ts` (110 lines)

**Purpose:** Validates TDD context (tdd_aware, tdd_stage) passed to all reviewers

**Key Assertions:**
- task-flow.yaml: code_review_request includes tdd_aware and tdd_stage ✅
- task-flow.yaml: security_request includes tdd_aware and tdd_stage ✅
- in-review-task-flow.yaml: code_review_request includes tdd_aware and tdd_stage ✅
- in-review-task-flow.yaml: security_request includes tdd_aware and tdd_stage ✅
- review-failure-handling.yaml: PM evaluation receives TDD context ✅

**Behavioral Patterns Extracted:**

1. **TDD Context Propagation:**
   - All reviewers receive `tdd_aware` and `tdd_stage` variables
   - Prevents reviewers from failing tasks with intentional failing tests
   - TDD stages: `write_failing_test`, `failing_test`, `make_test_pass`, `refactor`

2. **QA TDD Awareness (From personas.ts):**
   - QA prompt includes TDD awareness logic
   - If `tdd_stage: write_failing_test` → `status="pass"` when new failing test created
   - If `tdd_stage: failing_test` → `status="pass"` when test intentionally fails
   - For all other cases → `status="fail"` if any tests fail

3. **Cross-Review TDD Uniformity:**
   - Code review receives TDD context ✅
   - Security review receives TDD context ✅
   - QA review receives TDD context ✅ (from persona prompt)
   - **DevOps review:** NOT TESTED (needs verification)

**Critical Gap:** Test only validates **Code and Security** TDD context, not:
- QA review TDD context in YAML workflows
- DevOps review TDD context

---

| **Iteration Limits** | ✅ Max iterations enforced | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | ⚠️ NOT TESTED | ⚠️ NOT TESTED |

**Legend:**
- ✅ **Implemented & Tested:** Feature exists and test validates it
- ⚠️ **Unknown/Not Tested:** Feature may exist but no test coverage found
- ❌ **Not Implemented:** Feature explicitly missing

## Critical Findings

### 1. **QA Review Lacks Severity Classification** ❌

**Current State:**
- QA persona prompt: Binary pass/fail only
- No SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW classification
- All test failures treated equally (no prioritization)

**Impact:**
- PM cannot prioritize QA-generated tasks by severity
- Dashboard shows all QA tasks with same priority
- Critical test failures (e.g., auth broken) indistinguishable from minor failures (e.g., typo in console log)

**Code Evidence (personas.ts):**
```typescript
"tester-qa": "Run the project's test suite and linters... 
Always provide actionable feedback."
// NO severity levels defined
```

**Comparison (Code Review):**
```typescript
"code-reviewer": "...Severity levels: 
SEVERE=blocking issues (compile errors, critical bugs), 
HIGH=significant problems (major tech debt, performance issues), 
MEDIUM=code smells (minor violations, style issues), 
LOW=suggestions (refactoring opportunities)..."
```

**Questions:**
- **Q1:** Should QA review adopt the same 4-tier severity model (SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)?
- **Q2:** If yes, what constitutes SEVERE vs HIGH vs MEDIUM vs LOW for test failures?
  - SEVERE: Core functionality broken (auth, data loss, crashes)?
  - HIGH: Important features broken (search, notifications)?
  - MEDIUM: Edge cases, non-critical features?
  - LOW: Style/lint failures, console warnings?
- **Q3:** Should QA severity map to task priority (like Code/Security do)?

---

### 2. **DevOps Review Has Minimal Test Coverage** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- DevOps persona prompt exists (basic JSON response)
- NO tests found in severityReviewSystem.test.ts
- NO TDD context tests for DevOps
- NO severity levels documented

**Impact:**
- DevOps review behavior undefined
- Unclear if DevOps should have severity levels
- No validation of DevOps review consistency with other reviews

**Code Evidence (personas.ts):**
```typescript
"devops": "Keep builds fast & observable (OTel). 
Block prod deploys unless SAST passes. 
Output: CI/CD patch, SAST config, observability hooks. 
Respond with JSON {\"status\":\"pass\"|\"fail\",\"details\":\"...\",
\"pr_url\":\"...\",\"pipeline_status\":\"...\"}..."
```

**Questions:**
- **Q4:** Should DevOps review have severity levels (SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)?
- **Q5:** If yes, what constitutes severity for DevOps failures?
  - SEVERE: Build completely broken, SAST critical vulnerabilities?
  - HIGH: Slow builds, SAST high-risk findings?
  - MEDIUM: Missing observability, incomplete CI/CD?
  - LOW: Suggestions (caching, parallelization)?
- **Q6:** Should DevOps failures trigger PM evaluation like other reviews?

---

### 3. **Iteration Limits Not Defined for Code/Security/DevOps Reviews** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- QA review: Max iterations enforced (test validates non-hanging)
- Code review: NO iteration limit tests found
- Security review: NO iteration limit tests found
- DevOps review: NO iteration limit tests found

**Impact:**
- Potential infinite loops if PM repeatedly requests immediate fix
- No graceful degradation when reviews fail repeatedly
- Unclear what "max iterations" should be (production value unknown)

**Questions:**
- **Q7:** Should all review types have max iteration limits (same as QA)?
- **Q8:** If yes, should limits be configurable per review type?
  - QA: 10 iterations (test-fix-test cycles)
  - Code: 5 iterations (code-review-fix cycles)
  - Security: 3 iterations (security-fix-verify cycles)
  - DevOps: 3 iterations (build-fix-rebuild cycles)
- **Q9:** What should happen when max iterations exceeded?
  - Abort workflow with diagnostic logs (like Test Group 4)?
  - Create tasks anyway and continue (current QA behavior)?
  - Escalate to human (manual intervention)?

---

### 4. **Stage Detection Only in Security Review** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- Security review PM context includes stage detection (MVP/POC/beta/production)
- Code review PM context includes milestone completion % but NOT stage detection
- QA review: NO stage detection found
- DevOps review: NO stage detection found

**Impact:**
- Only security reviews can adjust severity based on project stage
- Code reviews don't account for MVP vs production (may over-prioritize style issues in MVP)
- QA reviews don't account for stage (may block MVP with non-critical test failures)

**Code Evidence (severityReviewSystem.test.ts):**
```typescript
// Security PM context includes STAGE DETECTION
expect(securityContext).toContain('STAGE DETECTION');
expect(securityContext).toContain('MVP');
expect(securityContext).toContain('POC');
expect(securityContext).toContain('production');

// Code review PM context does NOT include stage detection
// (only has milestone_completion_percentage)
```

**Questions:**
- **Q10:** Should all reviews use stage detection (MVP/POC/beta/production)?
- **Q11:** If yes, how should stage affect severity interpretation per review type?
  - **Code Review:** MVP → defer MEDIUM/LOW, Production → immediate HIGH/SEVERE?
  - **Security Review:** Current logic (SEVERE always immediate, HIGH depends on stage)?
  - **QA Review:** MVP → allow some test failures, Production → all tests must pass?
  - **DevOps Review:** MVP → basic CI, Production → full SAST + observability?
- **Q12:** Where does stage detection come from?
  - Milestone metadata (manual flag)?
  - Git branch naming convention (main=production, feature/*=MVP)?
  - Inferred from milestone_completion_percentage (<30% = MVP, >70% = production)?

---

### 5. **Response Format Standardization Incomplete** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- Code/Security: Highly structured JSON with severity arrays
- QA: Simple JSON {status, details, test counts, failures}
- DevOps: Simple JSON {status, details, pr_url, pipeline_status}

**Impact:**
- PM parsing logic must handle different response schemas
- Dashboard cannot uniformly display findings across review types
- Difficult to compare severity across different review types

**Comparison:**

**Code/Security (Structured):**
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "summary": "...",
  "findings": {
    "severe": [{file, line, issue, recommendation}],
    "high": [...],
    "medium": [...],
    "low": [...]
  }
}
```

**QA (Simple):**
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "test_framework": "vitest",
  "passed": 5,
  "failed": 2,
  "skipped": 0,
  "failures": [
    {"test": "...", "error": "...", "stack": "..."}
  ]
}
```

**DevOps (Simple):**
```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "details": "...",
  "pr_url": "...",
  "pipeline_status": "failed"
}
```

**Questions:**
- **Q13:** Should all reviews use the same JSON structure?
- **Q14:** If yes, should we migrate QA/DevOps to severity-based format?
  - QA findings: `{severe: [critical test failures], high: [important tests], ...}`
  - DevOps findings: `{severe: [build broken, critical SAST], high: [slow builds], ...}`
- **Q15:** If no, how should PM parse different formats consistently?

---

### 6. **TDD Awareness May Not Be Universal** ⚠️

**Current State:**
- Code review: TDD context passed in YAML (tdd_aware, tdd_stage) ✅
- Security review: TDD context passed in YAML (tdd_aware, tdd_stage) ✅
- QA review: TDD awareness in persona prompt ✅ (BUT NOT tested in YAML workflows)
- DevOps review: TDD context NOT tested ❌

**Impact:**
- DevOps may fail builds with intentionally failing tests (TDD Red phase)
- QA TDD awareness only in prompt, not validated in workflow integration
- Inconsistent TDD handling across reviews

**Questions:**
- **Q16:** Should ALL reviews receive TDD context in YAML workflows?
  - Current: Code ✅, Security ✅, QA ⚠️ (prompt only), DevOps ❌
  - Target: Code ✅, Security ✅, QA ✅, DevOps ✅
- **Q17:** What should DevOps do during TDD Red phase (intentional build failures)?
  - Allow build failures if tdd_stage=write_failing_test?
  - Only fail on syntax errors, not test failures?
- **Q18:** Should TDD stages affect review severity interpretation?
  - write_failing_test: All reviews more lenient (only fail on syntax errors)?
  - failing_test: Only fail reviews if failures OUTSIDE expected TDD test?
  - make_test_pass: Normal review behavior?
  - refactor: Extra emphasis on code quality (Code Review more strict)?

---

## Consistency Recommendations

### ✅ Keep Consistent (Already Uniform)

1. **Workflow Pattern:** All reviews use review-failure-handling sub-workflow
2. **Trigger Logic:** All reviews use `fail || unknown` → PM evaluation
3. **TDD Context Propagation:** All reviews receive tdd_aware/tdd_stage (expand to DevOps)
4. **Failure Handling:** All reviews follow same PM prioritization flow

### ⚠️ Consider Standardizing (Currently Inconsistent)

1. **Severity Levels:** Extend to QA and DevOps (4-tier: SEVERE/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
2. **Response Format:** Migrate all reviews to severity-based JSON structure
3. **Stage Detection:** Add to Code/QA/DevOps (currently only Security)
4. **Iteration Limits:** Define max iterations for all review types
5. **Review Logs:** Document log paths for QA and DevOps (like Code/Security)

### ❌ Allow Differentiation (Legitimate Differences)

1. **Finding Fields:** Each review type has domain-specific fields
   - Code: {file, line, issue, recommendation}
   - Security: {category, vulnerability, impact, mitigation}
   - QA: {test, error, stack, root_cause} (if standardized)
   - DevOps: {component, issue, fix, pr_url} (if standardized)

2. **Severity Definitions:** Each review type defines severity differently
   - Code SEVERE: Compile errors, critical bugs
   - Security SEVERE: RCE, auth bypass, data exposure
   - QA SEVERE: Core functionality broken (auth, data loss)
   - DevOps SEVERE: Build completely broken, critical SAST findings

  - Option B: Only fail on syntax errors, not test failures
- **Q18:** Should TDD stages affect review severity interpretation?
  - Example: write_failing_test → only fail on syntax errors (more lenient)

### Lower Priority Questions (Can Defer)

**Q19:** Should review logs be stored consistently across all review types?
- Current: Code/Security in `.ma/reviews/`, QA/DevOps undocumented

**Q20:** Should all reviews require the same response fields (status, summary, findings)?
- Current: Code/Security require all, QA/DevOps have simpler schemas

**Q21:** Should PM context be enhanced uniformly across all review types?
- Current: Security has most context (severity + stage + milestone), Code has less, QA minimal

**Q22:** Should iteration limits count PM revision cycles or review execution attempts?
- Current: Unclear if "iteration" = PM asks for plan revision, or = review re-executes

## Appendix: Code Comparison

### A. Persona Prompts (Current State)

**Code Reviewer (Has Severity):**
```typescript
"code-reviewer": "...Severity levels: SEVERE=blocking issues (compile errors, 
critical bugs), HIGH=significant problems (major tech debt, performance issues), 
MEDIUM=code smells (minor violations, style issues), LOW=suggestions 
(refactoring opportunities). Use status=\"fail\" when SEVERE or HIGH findings exist..."

(known CVEs, weak crypto), MEDIUM=security concerns (missing headers, 
outdated deps), LOW=security improvements (hardening opportunities). 
Use status=\"fail\" when SEVERE or HIGH findings exist..."
```

**QA Tester (NO Severity):**
```typescript
"tester-qa": "Run the project's test suite and linters...

### B. TDD Awareness (Current State)

**QA (Has TDD in Prompt):**
```typescript
"IMPORTANT TDD AWARENESS: If payload includes 'is_tdd_failing_test_stage: true' 
or 'tdd_stage: write_failing_test', this is TDD Red phase where goal is to 
CREATE a failing test. In this case, respond with {\"status\": \"pass\", 
\"tdd_red_phase_detected\": true} if a new failing test was successfully 
created and executed (expected to fail)..."
```

**Code/Security (Has TDD in YAML):**
```yaml
# task-flow.yaml
code_review_request:
  type: PersonaRequestStep
  config:
    payload:
      tdd_aware: ${tdd_aware}
      tdd_stage: ${tdd_stage}
```

**DevOps (NO TDD Mentioned):**
- Not found in persona prompt
- Not tested in YAML workflows

### C. PM Context (Current State)

**Security Review PM (Most Complete):**
```yaml
pm_prioritize_security_failures:
  config:
    payload:
      context_for_pm: |
        SEVERITY LEVELS EXPLAINED...
        STAGE DETECTION (MVP/POC/beta/production)...
        DECISION FRAMEWORK...
        ALWAYS require immediate fix if SEVERE...
      milestone_name: ${milestone_name}
      milestone_status: ${milestone_status}
      milestone_completion_percentage: ${milestone_completion_percentage}
      detected_stage: ${detected_stage}  # <-- Stage detection
```

**Code Review PM (No Stage Detection):**
```yaml
pm_prioritize_code_review_failures:
  config:
    payload:
      context_for_pm: |
        SEVERITY LEVELS EXPLAINED...
        DECISION FRAMEWORK...
        # NO STAGE DETECTION
      milestone_name: ${milestone_name}
      milestone_completion_percentage: ${milestone_completion_percentage}
      # NO detected_stage variable
```

**QA PM (Minimal Context):**
```yaml
# QA uses QAFailureCoordinationStep (inline PM eval)
# NO severity guidance in context
# NO stage detection
```
