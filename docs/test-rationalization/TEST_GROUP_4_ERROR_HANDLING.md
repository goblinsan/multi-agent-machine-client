# Test Group 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases Analysis
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete - Awaiting USER CHECKPOINT #6  
**Test Files Analyzed:** 3 files (80 + 299 + 72 = 451 lines)

---

## Executive Summary

Test Group 4 focuses on **error handling, retry mechanisms, timeout management, and edge case recovery**. These tests validate the system's resilience when things go wrong—network failures, persona timeouts, blocked tasks, and repository resolution issues.

**Critical Finding:** The current retry/timeout system uses **progressive timeouts** (increasing with each retry) but **no delays between attempts**. This may exhaust retries quickly during transient failures.

---

## Files Analyzed

### 1. `tests/qaFailure.test.ts` (80 lines)
**Purpose:** Validates QA failure workflow doesn't hang  
**Key Scenarios:**
- QA failure processing completes without hanging (business outcome test)
- Uses 20-iteration safety limit + mocking to prevent infinite loops
- Tests workflow execution, not specific error recovery

**Test Pattern:**
```typescript
await coordinator.handleCoordinator({}, context, { repo: tempRepo });
```

**Assertions:**
- `workflowExecuted` should be `true` (even if workflow fails)
- Tests for **non-hanging behavior**, not error handling

---

### 2. `tests/blockedTaskResolution.test.ts` (299 lines)
**Purpose:** Validates blocked task unblock workflow and retry limits  
**Key Scenarios:**
1. **Route blocked tasks** to `blocked-task-resolution` workflow
2. **Max unblock attempts** configuration respected
3. **Increment attempt counter** on each unblock attempt
4. **Analyze before unblocking** (lead-engineer evaluates)
5. **Mark task as open** after successful unblock

**Test Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'blocked-task-1',
  status: 'blocked',
  blocked_attempt_count: 2,
  blocked_reason: 'Context scan failed',
  failed_step: 'context_request'
}
```

**Blocked Task Workflow:**
1. Lead engineer analyzes blockage
2. Proposes unblock strategy (retry_with_context, create_subtasks, escalate, etc.)
3. UnblockAttemptStep executes strategy
4. QA validates unblock was successful
5. Task status updated to 'open' (or stays blocked if failed)

**Max Attempts Check:**
```typescript
blocked_attempt_count: 10  // Already at max
// Should escalate or mark permanently blocked
```

---

### 3. `tests/repoResolutionFallback.test.ts` (72 lines)
**Purpose:** Validates repository resolution with PROJECT_BASE fallback  
**Key Scenarios:**
1. **Clone HTTPS remote** under PROJECT_BASE
2. **Ignore local filesystem paths** as repo remotes (use repository field)
3. **Use local repo** when payload.repo points to valid git repo

**Repository Resolution Logic:**
- If `payload.repo` is HTTPS: Clone to `PROJECT_BASE/<project_name>`
- If `payload.repo` is local path: Use `payload.repository` field for remote
- If `payload.repo` is valid git repo: Use as-is (local development)

**Edge Cases:**
- Windows paths (`C:/Users/...`) should be ignored
- PROJECT_BASE should be respected (never clone outside)
- Repository name sanitization (remove special chars)

---

## Error Handling Mechanisms

### 1. Timeout Configuration (Persona-Specific)

**Timeout Sources (Priority Order):**
1. **Per-step override:** `config.timeout` (highest priority)
2. **Persona-specific:** `cfg.personaTimeouts[persona]`
3. **Default:** `cfg.personaDefaultTimeoutMs` (60 seconds)

**Configured Timeouts:**
```typescript
personaTimeouts: {
  'context': 60000,           // 1 minute (fast context scan)
  'lead-engineer': 90000,     // 1.5 minutes (analysis)
  'qa-engineer': 120000       // 2 minutes (testing)
}
```

**Progressive Timeout Formula:**
```typescript
timeout_attempt_N = base_timeout + (N - 1) * increment
// increment = cfg.personaRetryBackoffIncrementMs (default: 30000ms = 30s)

// Example for lead-engineer:
// Attempt 1: 90s
// Attempt 2: 120s (90 + 30)
// Attempt 3: 150s (90 + 60)
// Attempt 4: 180s (90 + 90)
```

**Rationale:** Each retry gets more time (transient issues may resolve)

---

### 2. Retry Configuration (Persona-Specific)

**Max Retries Sources (Priority Order):**
1. **Per-step override:** `config.maxRetries` (highest priority)
2. **Persona-specific:** `cfg.personaMaxRetries[persona]`
3. **Default:** `cfg.personaDefaultMaxRetries` (3 retries)

**Configured Max Retries:**
```typescript
personaMaxRetries: {
  'context': 3,               // 3 retries (context scan)
  'lead-engineer': 5,         // 5 retries (complex analysis)
  'qa-engineer': null         // unlimited (critical validation)
}
```

**Total Attempts Calculation:**
```
total_attempts = 1 (initial) + max_retries
```

**Example:**
- `lead-engineer`: 1 initial + 5 retries = **6 total attempts**
- `context`: 1 initial + 3 retries = **4 total attempts**
- `qa-engineer`: Unlimited (will timeout eventually)

---

### 3. Retry Behavior (NO Delays Between Attempts)

**Current Implementation:**
- **No artificial delays** between retry attempts
- Retries happen **immediately** after timeout
- Progressive timeout is the only backoff mechanism

**Test Validation:**
```typescript
it('should not have delays between retry attempts', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  // 3 retries happen immediately
  await step.execute(context);
  
  const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
  expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100); // <100ms for 3 retries
});
```

**Implication:**
- Rapid retry exhaustion during transient failures
- If dashboard API is down for 30s, all 3 retries will fail within 100ms
- **Contrast with Test Group 3 decision:** Exponential backoff with delays (1s/2s/4s)

---

### 4. Blocked Task Retry Limits

**Blocked Task Attempt Tracking:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  blocked_attempt_count: number;  // Tracks unblock attempts
  blocked_reason: string;         // Why task is blocked
  failed_step: string;            // Which step failed
}
```

**Max Attempts Logic:**
- Configurable max attempts (default: 10?)
- After max attempts: Escalate or mark permanently blocked
- Each unblock attempt increments counter
- Counter persists across workflow runs

**Test Scenario:**
```typescript
blocked_attempt_count: 10  // Already at max
// Workflow should:
// 1. Check if at max
// 2. Skip unblock attempt
// 3. Escalate to manual intervention
// 4. Update task status to 'escalated' or 'permanently_blocked'
```

---

### 5. Repository Resolution Fallback

**Resolution Strategy (Fallback Chain):**
1. **Try local repo:** If `payload.repo` is valid git repo → use as-is
2. **Try HTTPS remote:** If `payload.repo` is HTTPS → clone to PROJECT_BASE
3. **Try repository field:** If `payload.repository` exists → use as remote
4. **Fail:** If none of above work → error

**PROJECT_BASE Enforcement:**
- All clones happen under `cfg.projectBase` (e.g., `/projects`)
- Never clone to arbitrary locations (security)
- Project name sanitization (remove `.git`, special chars)

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Windows paths ignored (not treated as remotes)
- Local paths without `.git` directory → fail gracefully
- SSH vs HTTPS remotes (both supported)

---

## Business Intent Questions

### Q1: Persona Retry Strategy - Why No Delays?
**Current Behavior:** Retries happen immediately after timeout (no delays)

**Options:**
1. **Keep immediate retries** (current) - Fast failure, rapid retry exhaustion
2. **Add exponential backoff** (like Test Group 3) - 1s/2s/4s delays between retries
3. **Add fixed delay** - e.g., 5s between all retries
4. **Hybrid approach** - Immediate first retry, then delays for subsequent retries

**Trade-offs:**
- **Immediate retries:** Fast success on intermittent failures, but wastes attempts on sustained failures
- **Backoff delays:** Better for sustained failures (DB down, network partition), but slower recovery

**Question for User:** Should persona requests use exponential backoff (like task creation), or keep immediate retries?

---

### Q2: Progressive Timeout - Is 30s Increment Correct?
**Current Behavior:** Each retry gets +30s more timeout

**Example (lead-engineer):**
- Attempt 1: 90s
- Attempt 2: 120s (+30s)
- Attempt 3: 150s (+60s)
- Attempt 4: 180s (+90s)
- Attempt 5: 210s (+120s)
- Attempt 6: 240s (+150s) = **4 minutes**

**Rationale:**
- Transient issues may resolve over time
- LLM responses may get faster as load decreases
- Longer timeout for later attempts gives more time to succeed

**Question for User:** Is 30s increment appropriate, or should it be smaller (15s) / larger (60s)?

---

### Q3: Unlimited Retries for QA - Is This Safe?
**Current Behavior:** QA persona has `maxRetries: null` (unlimited)

**Implication:**
- QA failures will retry indefinitely until timeout exhausted
- With progressive timeout, attempt 10+ could be 60s + 10*30s = **6 minutes** per attempt
- Total time for 10 attempts: 1m + 1.5m + 2m + 2.5m + 3m + ... = **~30 minutes**

**Risk:**
- Workflows could hang for hours if QA keeps timing out
- No upper bound on retry duration

**Question for User:** Should QA have a reasonable max retry limit (e.g., 10 attempts), or keep unlimited?

---

### Q4: Blocked Task Max Attempts - What's the Limit?
**Current Behavior:** Test mocks `blocked_attempt_count: 10` (suggests limit of 10)

**Not Found in Code:**
- No explicit constant `MAX_UNBLOCK_ATTEMPTS`
- No configuration field `cfg.maxUnblockAttempts`

**Implication:**
- Max attempts may be hardcoded (bad) or missing (worse)
- No clear escalation path after max attempts

**Question for User:** What should the max unblock attempts be? Should it be configurable?

---

### Q5: Blocked Task Escalation - What Happens After Max Attempts?
**Current Behavior:** Test doesn't verify escalation action

**Possible Escalation Actions:**
1. **Mark as permanently blocked** - status = 'permanently_blocked'
2. **Create escalation task** - New task assigned to human
3. **Send notification** - Email/Slack alert to team
4. **Workflow abort** - Stop processing, require manual intervention
5. **Do nothing** - Leave task blocked (bad UX)

**Question for User:** What should happen when unblock attempts are exhausted?

---

### Q6: Persona Timeout vs Workflow Step Timeout - Which Wins?
**Current Behavior:** Workflow steps have timeout config, personas have timeout config

**Conflict Scenario:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: qa_request
    type: persona_request
    timeout: 180000  # 3 minutes (workflow step timeout)
    config:
      persona: qa-engineer  # Has 120000ms (2 minutes) timeout
```

**Resolution Priority:**
1. **Per-step timeout override** (180000ms) - highest priority
2. **Persona-specific timeout** (120000ms) - medium priority
3. **Default timeout** (60000ms) - lowest priority

**Question for User:** Is this priority order correct? Should workflow step timeout override persona timeout?

---

### Q7: Repository Resolution - What If All Fallbacks Fail?
**Current Behavior:** Tests validate happy paths, not complete failure

**Failure Scenario:**
- `payload.repo` is invalid local path
- `payload.repository` is missing
- No valid remote URL available

**Current Behavior:** Likely throws error, workflow fails

**Question for User:** Should workflow abort on repo resolution failure, or create task for manual intervention?

---

### Q8: PROJECT_BASE Security - Should We Validate Path Traversal?
**Current Behavior:** Clones to `PROJECT_BASE/<project_name>`

**Security Risk:**
```typescript
project_name: '../../../etc/passwd'  // Path traversal attack
// Results in clone to: /projects/../../../etc/passwd
```

**Mitigation:**
- Sanitize project_name (remove `../`, special chars)
- Validate path stays within PROJECT_BASE (absolute path check)

**Question for User:** Should we add path traversal validation to repoDirectoryFor()?

---

### Q9: Retry Count Logging - Should We Track Attempt History?
**Current Behavior:** Tests verify retry happens, but don't verify logging

**Useful Logging:**
- Total attempts made
- Timeout used for each attempt
- Failure reason for each attempt
- Time spent on each attempt

**Use Case:**
- Debugging why persona requests fail
- Identifying patterns (always fails on attempt 3)
- Performance analysis (increasing timeout helps?)

**Question for User:** Should we add detailed retry logging (attempt-by-attempt history)?

---

### Q10: Workflow Abort on Persona Exhaustion - Should We Abort?
**Current Behavior:** After retry exhaustion, step returns failure status

**Workflow Continuation:**
- Current: Workflow continues after persona failure (may cause cascading failures)
- Alternative: Abort workflow immediately (fail fast)

**Test Group 3 Decision:** Abort workflow on partial failure after retry exhaustion (task creation)

**Consistency Question:** Should persona retry exhaustion also abort workflow?

---

### Q11: Transient vs Permanent Failures - Should We Distinguish?
**Current Behavior:** All failures treated the same (retry until exhausted)

**Failure Types:**
1. **Transient:** Network timeout, database lock, rate limit (should retry)
2. **Permanent:** Invalid payload, missing permissions, not found (shouldn't retry)

**Optimization:**
- Detect permanent failures early (don't waste retries)
- Example: 404 Not Found → don't retry
- Example: 503 Service Unavailable → do retry

**Question for User:** Should we differentiate transient vs permanent failures (like HTTP status codes)?

---

### Q12: Blocked Task Analysis - Should We Cache Results?
**Current Behavior:** Lead engineer analyzes blockage on each unblock attempt

**Optimization:**
- Cache blockage analysis for N attempts (avoid redundant LLM calls)
- Example: Cache for 3 attempts, re-analyze on attempt 4
- Rationale: Root cause unlikely to change within minutes

**Trade-off:**
- **Cache:** Faster, cheaper, but may miss changing conditions
- **Re-analyze:** Slower, expensive, but always fresh

**Question for User:** Should blockage analysis be cached, or re-run every attempt?

---

### Q13: Repository Clone - Should We Cache Clones?
**Current Behavior:** Tests don't cover clone caching/reuse

**Optimization:**
- Clone once to PROJECT_BASE
- Reuse clone for subsequent workflows (git pull to update)
- Only clone if directory doesn't exist

**Risk:**
- Stale clones (out of date)
- Dirty working directory (uncommitted changes)

**Mitigation:**
- Always `git fetch` before workflow
- Check if working directory clean
- Optionally delete and re-clone if dirty

**Question for User:** Should we cache repository clones, or clone fresh every time?

---

### Q14: Timeout Error Messages - Should We Include Context?
**Current Behavior:** Error message: `"Step 'X' timed out after Yms"`

**Enhanced Error Message:**
```
Step 'qa_request' timed out after 120000ms
- Persona: qa-engineer
- Attempt: 2 of 5
- Progressive timeout: 120s (base 90s + 30s increment)
- Previous attempts: 90s (timeout), 120s (timeout)
- Suggestion: Check LM Studio availability, increase timeout
```

**Use Case:**
- Debugging timeout issues
- Understanding why step failed
- Actionable suggestions for fixing

**Question for User:** Should timeout error messages include detailed context and suggestions?

---

### Q15: Blocked Task Recovery - Should We Auto-Retry After Delay?
**Current Behavior:** Blocked tasks require workflow restart to retry

**Alternative:**
- After unblock attempt fails, schedule retry in N minutes
- Example: "Retry in 5 minutes" (gives system time to recover)
- Auto-retry up to max attempts, then escalate

**Use Case:**
- Transient blockages (database down, network issue)
- System self-heals after delay
- Reduces manual intervention

**Question for User:** Should blocked tasks auto-retry after a delay, or wait for manual workflow restart?

---

## Test Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Add Error Type Tests
**Missing Coverage:**
- Network errors (ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT)
- Database errors (lock timeout, connection pool exhausted)
- LLM errors (rate limit, model unavailable)
- Validation errors (invalid payload, missing fields)

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
describe('Error Type Handling', () => {
  it('retries on network errors', async () => {
    mockFetch.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('ECONNRESET'));
    mockFetch.mockResolvedValueOnce({ ok: true });
    // Should retry and succeed
  });

  it('fails fast on validation errors', async () => {
    mockFetch.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Invalid JSON'));
    // Should NOT retry (permanent failure)
  });
});
```

---

### 2. Add Retry Exhaustion Tests
**Missing Coverage:**
- What happens after all retries exhausted?
- Does workflow abort or continue?
- Is error logged with full context?

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
it('aborts workflow after retry exhaustion', async () => {
  mockPersona.mockRejectedValue(new Error('Timeout'));
  const result = await workflow.execute();
  expect(result.status).toBe('aborted');
  expect(result.error).toMatch(/exhausted all retries/);
});
```

---

### 3. Add Timeout Accuracy Tests
**Missing Coverage:**
- Do timeouts fire at correct time?
- Is progressive timeout calculation correct?
- Are timeouts canceled after success?

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
it('respects progressive timeout calculation', async () => {
  const timeouts: number[] = [];
  mockWait.mockImplementation((timeout) => {
    timeouts.push(timeout);
    throw new Error('Timeout');
  });
  
  await step.execute(context);
  expect(timeouts).toEqual([90000, 120000, 150000]);
});
```

---

### 4. Add Blocked Task State Machine Tests
**Missing Coverage:**
- State transitions (open → blocked → open)
- Invalid transitions (blocked → done without unblock)
- Concurrent unblock attempts

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
describe('Blocked Task State Machine', () => {
  it('transitions open → blocked → open', async () => {
    await task.block('Context failed');
    expect(task.status).toBe('blocked');
    
    await task.unblock();
    expect(task.status).toBe('open');
  });

  it('prevents invalid transitions', async () => {
    await task.block();
    await expect(task.complete()).rejects.toThrow('Cannot complete blocked task');
  });
});
```

---

### 5. Add Repository Resolution Error Tests
**Missing Coverage:**
- Invalid URLs (malformed, unsupported protocol)
- Clone failures (permissions, disk space)
- Path traversal attacks

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
describe('Repository Resolution Errors', () => {
  it('rejects path traversal attempts', async () => {
    const payload = { repo: '../../../etc', project_name: 'passwd' };
    await expect(resolveRepo(payload)).rejects.toThrow('Invalid project name');
  });

  it('handles clone permission errors', async () => {
    mockGit.mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Permission denied'));
    await expect(resolveRepo(payload)).rejects.toThrow('Failed to clone');
  });
});
```

---

## Consistency Analysis

### Comparison with Test Group 3 Decisions

| Aspect | Test Group 3 (Task Creation) | Test Group 4 (Persona Requests) | Consistent? |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Retry Strategy** | Exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s) | Immediate retries (no delay) | ❌ NO |
| **Max Attempts** | 3 retries (4 total attempts) | Persona-specific (3-5 retries) | ⚠️ SIMILAR |
| **Abort on Exhaustion** | Yes, abort workflow | No, workflow continues | ❌ NO |
| **Progressive Timeout** | No (fixed timeout) | Yes (+30s per attempt) | ❌ NO |
| **Error Logging** | Log all attempts | Not specified | ⚠️ NEEDS ALIGNMENT |

**Inconsistency:** Task creation uses exponential backoff WITH delays, persona requests use progressive timeout WITHOUT delays.

**Recommendation:** Align retry strategies—either both use backoff with delays, or both use immediate retries.

---

## Implementation Gaps

### 1. No Explicit MAX_UNBLOCK_ATTEMPTS Constant
**Issue:** Test mocks `blocked_attempt_count: 10` but no constant in code

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// src/config.ts
export const cfg = {
  maxUnblockAttempts: 10,  // Add this
  // ...
};
```

---

### 2. No Escalation Logic After Max Attempts
**Issue:** No code path for "what happens after max unblock attempts"

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// src/workflows/steps/UnblockAttemptStep.ts
if (task.blocked_attempt_count >= cfg.maxUnblockAttempts) {
  await escalateTask(task, 'Exhausted unblock attempts');
  return { status: 'escalated' };
}
```

---

###

 3. No Error Type Detection
**Issue:** All errors treated the same (retry on everything)

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
function isRetryableError(error: Error): boolean {
  const retryable = ['ECONNRESET', 'ETIMEDOUT', 'ENOTFOUND', '503'];
  return retryable.some(code => error.message.includes(code));
}
```

---

### 4. No Path Traversal Validation
**Issue:** `repoDirectoryFor()` doesn't validate path stays within PROJECT_BASE

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
function repoDirectoryFor(projectName: string): string {
  const sanitized = projectName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9-_]/g, '-');
  const resolved = path.resolve(cfg.projectBase, sanitized);
  
  // Ensure path is under PROJECT_BASE
  if (!resolved.startsWith(cfg.projectBase)) {
    throw new Error('Path traversal detected');
  }
  
  return resolved;
}
```

---

### 5. No Retry History Tracking
**Issue:** Can't see why retries failed (no historical log)

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
interface RetryHistory {
  attempt: number;
  timeout: number;
  startTime: number;
  endTime: number;
  error: string;
}

context.setVariable('retry_history', retryHistory);
```

---

### Error Handling Strengths
✅ Progressive timeout increases chance of success  
✅ Persona-specific timeout/retry configuration  
✅ Per-step timeout override capability  
✅ Blocked task attempt tracking
