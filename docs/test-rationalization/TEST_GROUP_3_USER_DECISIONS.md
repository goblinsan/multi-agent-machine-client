## Overview

This document captures the user's decisions on the 19 validation questions from Test Group 3 (Task Creation Logic). These decisions will guide the implementation in Phase 4 (Parser Consolidation) and Phase 5 (Dashboard API Integration).

**Key Takeaway:** The user has provided clear guidance on priority scores, milestone routing, assignee logic, and failure handling. Implementation should follow these decisions exactly.

## Priority Questions (Answered)

### Q1: Priority Score Standardization
**Question:** Should all review types use the same urgent priority (1000), or should QA remain higher at 1200?

**User Decision:** ✅ **Keep QA higher at 1200**

**Rationale:**
- QA failures indicate fundamental test failures (tests are failing)
- Code/Security/DevOps failures indicate code quality issues (code works but has issues)
- QA failures should be prioritized higher because they block all other work
- Differentiation helps engineers prioritize test failures over code improvements

**Implementation:**
- QA urgent priority: **1200** (highest)
- Code/Security/DevOps urgent priority: **1000** (high)
- All deferred priority: **50** (low)

**Code Location:**
- `src/workflows/steps/QAFailureCoordinationStep.ts` line 79: Keep `urgentPriorityScore = 1200`
- `src/workflows/steps/ReviewFailureTasksStep.ts` line 150: Keep `urgentPriorityScore = 1000`

---

### Q4: Milestone Routing for Urgent Tasks
**Question:** Should urgent tasks ALWAYS be assigned to the same milestone as the parent task (blocking deployment)?

**User Decision:** ✅ **Yes, always link urgent to parent milestone**

**Rationale:**
- Urgent tasks (critical/high priority) must be fixed before deployment
- Same milestone ensures task blocks deployment until fixed
- Prevents shipping broken code to production
- Deferred tasks (medium/low) go to backlog milestone (don't block deployment)

**Implementation:**
- Urgent tasks (critical/high): `milestone_id = parent.milestone_id`
- Deferred tasks (medium/low): `milestone_id = backlogMilestoneId` (default: 'future-enhancements')

**Code Location:**
- `src/workflows/steps/ReviewFailureTasksStep.ts` lines 177-180

**Edge Case Handling:**
- If parent milestone is missing: Log error, assign to project default milestone
- If project default milestone missing: Create 'default' milestone
- If backlog milestone missing for deferred: Create 'future-enhancements' milestone

---

### Q11: Assignee Persona Logic
**Question:** Should assignee_persona vary by review type, or always default to implementation-planner?

**User Decision:** ✅ **implementation-planner must always precede engineering**

**Interpretation:**
- All follow-up tasks should be assigned to `implementation-planner` (not direct to engineer)
- Implementation-planner reviews task, creates plan, THEN assigns to engineer
- This ensures proper planning before code changes (TDD awareness, test context, etc.)
- Applies to ALL review types (QA, Code, Security, DevOps)

**Implementation:**
- Always set `assignee_persona = 'implementation-planner'` for all follow-up tasks
- Remove any review-type-specific assignee logic
- Implementation-planner handles delegation to appropriate engineer

**Code Location:**
- `src/workflows/steps/ReviewFailureTasksStep.ts` (assignee logic in task creation)
- Ensure BulkTaskCreationStep sets `assignee_persona` field correctly

**Benefits:**
- Consistent workflow (all tasks go through planning)
- TDD context preserved (planner ensures test context passed to engineer)
- Proper prioritization (planner assesses urgency before assigning)

---

### Q14: Duplicate Detection Threshold
**Question:** Is 50% description overlap the correct threshold for duplicate detection?

**User Decision:** ✅ **50% seems like a fair starting point**

**Rationale:**
- 50% overlap catches obvious duplicates (same issue described differently)
- Not too strict (avoids false positives)
- Not too loose (avoids missing real duplicates)
- Can be adjusted based on production metrics

**Implementation:**
- Keep current threshold: **50% description overlap**
- Keep title normalization logic (remove emojis, brackets, markers)
- Log duplicate detections with overlap percentage for monitoring

**Code Location:**
- `src/workflows/steps/ReviewFailureTasksStep.ts` lines 390-450 (isDuplicateTask method)

**Future Monitoring:**
- Track false positive rate (tasks incorrectly marked as duplicates)
- Track false negative rate (duplicate tasks created)
- Adjust threshold if production data shows issues

---

### Q17: Task Creation Failure Handling
**Question:** Should task creation fail all tasks if any fails (atomic), or allow partial success?

**User Decision:** ✅ **Use backoff-retry, partial success on retry exhaustion should abort workflow**

**Rationale:**
- Transient failures (network, database timeout) should be retried
- After retry exhaustion, partial success indicates systemic issue
- Systemic issues should abort workflow (prevents cascading failures)
- Atomic failure without retry would be too strict (fails on transient issues)

**Implementation Strategy:**

**Retry Logic:**
1. **Initial Attempt:** Try to create all tasks
2. **On Failure:** Use exponential backoff retry (3 attempts max)
   - Retry 1: Wait 1 second, retry failed tasks
   - Retry 2: Wait 2 seconds, retry failed tasks
   - Retry 3: Wait 4 seconds, retry failed tasks
3. **After Retry Exhaustion:** 
   - If ALL tasks failed: Abort workflow with error
   - If SOME tasks created: Abort workflow with warning (partial success)
   - If ALL tasks created: Continue workflow

**Error Handling:**
- Log all failures with retry attempts
- Include task details in abort message (which tasks failed)
- Set workflow status to 'failed' on abort
- Create dashboard alert for manual intervention

**Code Location:**
- `src/workflows/steps/BulkTaskCreationStep.ts` (add retry logic)
- `src/workflows/WorkflowEngine.ts` (handle abort signal)

**Configuration:**
```typescript
const RETRY_CONFIG = {
  maxAttempts: 3,
  backoffMs: [1000, 2000, 4000],
  retryableErrors: ['ECONNRESET', 'ETIMEDOUT', 'ENOTFOUND']
};
```

**Abort Conditions:**
- Partial success after retry exhaustion (some tasks created, some failed)
- Complete failure after retry exhaustion (zero tasks created)
- Non-retryable errors (validation errors, duplicate key, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- Handles transient failures gracefully (network blips, DB locks)
- Prevents cascading failures (aborts on systemic issues)
- Provides visibility (logs all retry attempts)
- Allows manual intervention (dashboard alert on abort)

### Q19: Idempotency with external_id
**Question:** Should task creation be idempotent using external_id to prevent duplicate creation on workflow re-runs?

**User Decision:** ⏳ **Not sure on the case - provide recommendation**

**Recommendation:** ✅ **YES - Use external_id for idempotency**

**Rationale:**

**Problem:** Workflow re-runs (retries, manual restarts, system crashes) can create duplicate tasks:
- Worker crashes after review completes but before task creation recorded
- PM evaluation re-runs due to timeout
- Manual workflow restart after partial failure
- Sub-workflow retry after transient failure

**Solution:** Use `external_id` field as idempotency key:
- Generate deterministic external_id: `${workflow_run_id}:${step_id}:${task_index}`
- Dashboard checks for existing task with same external_id before creating
- If exists: Return existing task (201 Created or 200 OK)
- If not exists: Create new task with external_id

**Benefits:**
1. **Safe Retries:** Can retry task creation without fear of duplicates
2. **Workflow Restarts:** Can restart workflow from any step safely
3. **Debugging:** external_id traces task back to exact workflow run + step
4. **Auditability:** Clear lineage from review failure → PM decision → task creation

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Generate external_id in BulkTaskCreationStep**
```typescript
const externalId = `${context.workflow_run_id}:review-failure-handling:${index}`;
const task = {
  ...taskData,
  external_id: externalId
};
```

**Step 2: Add external_id to Dashboard Schema**
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN external_id TEXT UNIQUE;
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_external_id ON tasks(external_id);
```

**Step 3: Update Dashboard API to Check external_id**
```typescript
// POST /tasks endpoint
const existingTask = await db.get(
  'SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE external_id = ?',
  [body.external_id]
);
if (existingTask) {
  return reply.status(200).send(existingTask); // Idempotent response
}
// Create new task
```

**Step 4: Update Bulk Endpoint**
```typescript
// POST /tasks:bulk endpoint
for (const taskData of body.tasks) {
  const existing = await db.get(
    'SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE external_id = ?',
    [taskData.external_id]
  );
  if (existing) {
    results.push({ status: 'existing', task: existing });
  } else {
    const created = await createTask(taskData);
    results.push({ status: 'created', task: created });
  }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- `external_id` is optional (for backward compatibility)
- If not provided, use title + milestone_id for duplicate detection (existing logic)
- If provided, external_id takes precedence over title-based detection

**Code Locations:**
- `src/workflows/steps/BulkTaskCreationStep.ts` (generate external_id)
- `src/dashboard-backend/schema.sql` (add external_id column)
- `src/dashboard-backend/routes/tasks.ts` (check external_id before creating)
- `docs/dashboard-api/openapi.yaml` (add external_id to Task schema)

**Testing:**
- Test workflow re-run creates 0 duplicate tasks
- Test manual restart from mid-workflow creates 0 duplicate tasks
- Test partial failure + retry creates 0 duplicate tasks
- Test external_id collision returns existing task (not error)

**Recommendation Confidence:** 95% - Standard practice for idempotent APIs
