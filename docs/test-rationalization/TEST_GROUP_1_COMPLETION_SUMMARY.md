## Key Findings

### ✅ Architectural Validations

1. **Review Trigger Pattern** - CONFIRMED CORRECT
   - `fail` and `unknown` both trigger PM evaluation
   - Simple rule: anything not `pass` → PM eval
   - Defensive by design (unknown statuses go to PM)

2. **Sequential Review Flow** - CONFIRMED CORRECT
   - QA → Code → Security → DevOps → Done
   - Each review blocks next review until pass
   - PM handles all failures uniformly

3. **PM Evaluation Scope** - CONFIRMED CORRECT
   - All review failures trigger PM (no bypass)
   - PM handles severity/duplication decisions
   - No special task categories needed

### ⚠️ Items Needing Verification

1. **TDD Context in Reviews**
   - Reviews should be TDD-aware (understand failing tests are intentional)
   - Currently passes `tdd_aware` and `tdd_stage` to sub-workflows
   - **TODO:** Verify review prompts actually use this context
   - **TODO:** Test that reviewers don't fail tasks with intentional failing tests

2. **`workflow_mode` Variable**
   - User unsure of purpose ("don't know what workflow_mode is meant to represent")
   - May be legacy/unused variable
   - **TODO:** Search codebase for `workflow_mode` usage
   - **TODO:** Consider deprecating if unused

3. **TDD as Default**
   - User wants `tdd_aware` as default behavior
   - All workflows should understand TDD context
   - **TODO:** Make `tdd_aware` default to `true` at workflow level
   - **TODO:** Consider removing flag entirely if always enabled

### ❌ Critical Bug Found

**DevOps Review Failures Not Handled**

**Current Behavior:**
- DevOps failures don't trigger PM evaluation
- Tasks marked `done` if security passes (ignores DevOps status)
- DevOps issues go untracked

**Expected Behavior:**
- DevOps failures trigger `review-failure-handling` sub-workflow
- PM evaluates and creates follow-up tasks
- Tasks NOT marked `done` until DevOps passes

**Impact:** HIGH - DevOps concerns not addressed, tasks incorrectly marked complete

**Files Affected:**
- `src/workflows/definitions/task-flow.yaml` (missing PM step)
- `src/workflows/definitions/in-review-task-flow.yaml` (missing PM step)

## User Decisions (USER CHECKPOINT #3)

| Question | Answer | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Should `unknown` trigger PM eval? | YES - treat as fail | ✅ Confirmed |
| Is TDD governance fully implemented? | Reviews should understand TDD context | ⚠️ Verify |
| Should DevOps failures block completion? | YES - trigger PM eval | ❌ Bug found |
| Other review statuses besides 3? | No - but not "pass" → PM eval | ✅ Confirmed |
| Security-sensitive task metadata? | Not needed | ✅ Confirmed |
| Some reviews bypass PM eval? | No - PM handles all | ✅ Confirmed |
| `workflow_mode` vs `tdd_aware`? | Make TDD default, unclear on mode | ⚠️ Investigate |

## Action Items

### High Priority (Bugs - Must Fix)

1. **Fix DevOps Review Failure Handling** ❌
   - Add `pm_prioritize_devops_failures` step to task-flow.yaml
   - Add `pm_prioritize_devops_failures` step to in-review-task-flow.yaml
   - Update `mark_task_done` conditions to check DevOps status
   - Write unit tests for DevOps failure scenarios
   - **Estimated:** 1-2 days
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Risk:** Medium (workflow changes)

2. **Verify TDD Context in Review Prompts** ⚠️
   - Check if review-failure-handling sub-workflow uses `tdd_aware`/`tdd_stage`
   - Verify PM prompt template includes TDD context
   - Test that code/security reviewers understand failing tests are OK
   - **Estimated:** 4 hours
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Risk:** Low (validation only)

3. **Test Reviewers with Intentional Failing Tests** ⚠️
   - Create test task in `write_failing_test` stage
   - Submit for code review
   - Verify reviewer doesn't fail task
   - Document expected behavior
   - **Estimated:** 2 hours
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Risk:** Low (testing only)

### Medium Priority (Cleanup - Should Fix)

4. **Make `tdd_aware` Default** ⚠️
   - Set `tdd_aware: true` at workflow context level
   - Remove `tdd_aware || false` from all sub-workflow calls
   - Simplify YAML (less repetition)
   - **Estimated:** 2 hours
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Risk:** Low (simplification)

5. **Investigate `workflow_mode` Variable** ⚠️
   - Search codebase for `workflow_mode` usage
   - Document purpose if found
   - Remove if unused/legacy
   - **Estimated:** 1 hour
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Risk:** Low (investigation)

6. **Simplify Status Check Logic** ✅
   - Replace `== 'fail' || == 'unknown'` with `!= 'pass'`
   - Update all 4 workflows (QA, Code, Security, DevOps)
   - Shorter, clearer, handles future statuses
   - **Estimated:** 1 hour
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Risk:** Low (refactor)

### Low Priority (Enhancements - Nice to Have)

7. **Add Status Logging Differentiation** 
   - Log `unknown` differently from `fail` for debugging
   - Add metrics to track `unknown` frequency
   - **Estimated:** 2 hours
   - **Priority:** LOW
   - **Risk:** Low (monitoring)

8. **Document Timeout/Retry Logic** 
   - Document what leads to `unknown` status
   - Clarify timeout values
   - Add to workflow documentation
   - **Estimated:** 1 hour
   - **Priority:** LOW
   - **Risk:** None (documentation)

9. **Consider Removing `tdd_aware` Flag** 
   - If always enabled, remove the flag entirely
   - Simplify workflow YAML further
   - **Estimated:** 2 hours (after making it default)
   - **Priority:** LOW
   - **Risk:** Low (depends on #4)

## Test Scenarios Validated

### Scenario 1: Review Status Triggers ✅
```gherkin
Given a review returns "fail" or "unknown"
Then PM evaluation step executes
And PM decides whether to create tasks

Given a review returns "pass"
Then workflow proceeds to next stage
And PM evaluation is skipped
```

### Scenario 2: Sequential Review Dependencies ✅
```gherkin
Given QA passes
Then task marked "in_review"
And code review executes

Given code review passes
Then security review executes

Given security review passes
Then DevOps review executes

Given all reviews pass
Then task marked "done"
```

### Scenario 3: TDD Governance Gating ⚠️
```gherkin
Given task is TDD-aware
And tdd_stage = "write_failing_test" or "failing_test"
Then code/security reviewers understand failing tests are OK
And reviewers don't fail task for intentional test failures
```

**Note:** Needs verification that prompts include TDD context.

### Scenario 4: No Circular Dependencies ✅
```gherkin
Given a workflow with multiple review steps
When traversing dependency graph
Then no step depends on itself (direct or transitive)
And topological ordering exists
```

### Scenario 5: QA Iteration Loop Independence ✅
```gherkin
Given QA passes on first attempt
Then qa_iteration_loop is skipped
And mark_task_in_review still executes
And workflow doesn't wait for skipped step
```
