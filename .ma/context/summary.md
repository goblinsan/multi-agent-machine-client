## File Roles and Responsibilities

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `/src/worker.ts` (18.6 KB, 433 lines) | **Core execution engine** – Likely orchestrates agent workflows, handles task dispatching, and manages state transitions between agents. Most complex file in the project. |
| `/src/gitUtils.ts` (13.3 KB, 426 lines) | Handles Git operations: cloning, fetching, commit tracking, or repo inspection. Central to scanning and version control integration. |
| `/src/config.ts` (4.5 KB, 112 lines) | Stores project configuration (e.g., agent settings, paths, timeouts). Likely defines environment-specific variables. |
| `/src/dashboard.ts` (4.1 KB, 125 lines) | UI or API interface for monitoring agent activity; possibly exposes endpoints to view status, logs, or metrics. |
| `/src/fileops.ts` (2.8 KB, 71 lines) | File system operations: reading/writing files, path handling, file creation/deletion. |
| `/src/logger.ts` (2.8 KB, 102 lines) | Central logging layer – logs agent actions, errors, and debug messages. |
| `/src/scanRepo.ts` (2.5 KB, 68 lines) | Entry point for scanning repositories; likely called by the main application to initiate repo analysis. |
| `/src/personas.ts` (2.4 KB, ~lines not specified) | Defines agent personas – behavioral templates or roles (e.g., "researcher", "coder") used in multi-agent workflows. |
| `/src/tools/seed_example.ts` (1.9 KB, 55 lines) | Example tool demonstrating how tools are structured; likely a placeholder for dynamic tool injection. |
| `/src/artifacts.ts` (1.7 KB, 48 lines) | Manages output artifacts from agent execution – e.g., generated code, reports, files. |

> **No other files or directories** were observed in the scan.

## Size & Line Hotspots

### Top 5 by Size (Bytes)
| File | Size (bytes) |
|------|--------------|
| `/src/worker.ts` | 18,658 → **Largest** |
| `/src/gitUtils.ts` | 13,351 |
| `/src/config.ts` | 4,534 |
| `/src/dashboard.ts` | 4,144 |
| `/src/fileops.ts` | 2,820 |

### Top 5 by Line Count
| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `/src/worker.ts` | **433** → Longest and most complex |
| `/src/gitUtils.ts` | 426 |
| `/src/dashboard.ts` | 125 |
| `/src/logger.ts` | 102 |
| `/src/fileops.ts` | 71 |

> All files are under 500 lines, with the two core files (`worker.ts`, `gitUtils.ts`) being significantly larger and more complex.

## Files Likely to Be Touched Next (Rationale)

1. **`/src/worker.ts`**  
   - *Why*: Central to agent execution logic; largest in size and line count. Any change to workflow, task routing, or agent coordination would likely require modifying this file.  
   - *Next touch*: Adding new agent actions, improving state management, or integrating new tool calls.

2. **`/src/gitUtils.ts`**  
   - *Why*: Handles repo scanning and Git interaction; critical for the project’s core functionality (repo inspection).  
   - *Next touch*: Enhancing clone behavior, adding support for private repos, or improving error handling during fetch operations.

3. **`/src/config.ts`**  
   - *Why*: Configuration is a common entry point for environment-specific changes (e.g., debug mode, timeouts).  
   - *Next touch*: Adding new config options for agent behavior or performance tuning.

4. **`/src/tools/seed_example.ts`**  
   - *Why*: Serves as an example of how tools are structured; likely to be expanded into real tooling (e.g., code generation, search).  
   - *Next touch*: Refactor or extend this file to create new functional tools.

5. **`/src/artifacts.ts`**  
   - *Why*: Manages outputs from agent execution – essential for tracking results and debugging.  
   - *Next touch*: Improve artifact storage (e.g., JSON, file export), add versioning, or integrate with a dashboard.

## Alembic Migration Summary

❌ **Not observed in scan summary**  
→ No mention of Alembic, migration files, database schema changes, or `migrations/` directory.  

> **Conclusion**: This project does not use Alembic or any database migration system as per the scan data.

---

## Observations & Limitations

- ✅ All files are within expected size and line counts for a lightweight agent-based client.
- ✅ Core functionality is clearly split: Git operations, worker logic, configuration, logging, and tooling.
- ❌ No test files (e.g., `.spec.ts`, `test/`) were observed.  
- ❌ No `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` was included in the scan summary — **not observed**.  
- ❌ No database schema or ORM files (like `schema.ts` which appears to be minimal) — only 29 lines, likely a stub.
- ❌ No version control metadata (e.g., `.git`, commit history) was scanned.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The scan summary does not include file paths outside of `/src/`. All files are under `src/` or in the root. No external dependencies or scripts were observed.

---

## Final Summary

This project is a lightweight, agent-driven client for scanning and interacting with code repositories. It leverages modular components (worker, Git utils, personas) to enable autonomous analysis of source code. The core logic resides in `worker.ts` and `gitUtils.ts`, making them the primary focus areas.

No migration system or test suite was detected. The project appears to be in early development, with clear structure but minimal automation or testing infrastructure.

✅ **Project context fully hydrated based on scan summary**  
❌ **No Alembic migrations observed**  
❌ **No test files, config files (e.g., `package.json`), or external dependencies found**

> Ready for next-phase tasks: agent behavior expansion, tool integration, and logging improvements.
