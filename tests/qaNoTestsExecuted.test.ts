/**
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED TEST - Superseded by Phase 4-5
 * 
 * Test suite for QA validation when no tests are executed
 * 
 * Production Issue:
 * - QA agent returned status "pass" with message "0 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped"
 * - QA said "Since no tests are present in the provided codebase, there's nothing to execute"
 * - System treated this as PASS and proceeded to code review
 * - This is incorrect - if no tests can be executed, QA should FAIL
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * - QA returning "pass" with 0 tests executed should be overridden to "fail"
 * - Workflow should trigger PM coordination for this failure
 * 
 * Current equivalent tests:
 * - tests/phase4/ - Modern workflow validation
 * 
 * Skip Reason: Superseded by Phase 4-5 workflow system
 * Date Skipped: October 20, 2025
