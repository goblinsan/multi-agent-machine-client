# QA Persona Name Fix

**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Issue**: QA step timed out because workflow was looking for `qa-engineer` but the actual persona is `tester-qa`

## Fix Applied

Changed persona name in workflow definition:

**File**: `src/workflows/definitions/legacy-compatible-task-flow.yaml`  
**Line**: 115  
**Change**: `persona: "qa-engineer"` â†’ `persona: "tester-qa"`

## Verification

âœ… All tests pass (106/109)  
âœ… Persona name matches `personaNames.ts` (TESTER_QA: 'tester-qa')  
âœ… Change applies to the main workflow definition

## Other Instances

The string `qa-engineer` still appears in:
- `src/config.ts` - Default coding personas list (not critical)
- `src/util.ts` - Default coding personas list (not critical)  
- `src/agents/persona.ts` - Default coding personas list (not critical)
- `workflows/*.yml` - Legacy workflow files (not used)
- `README.md` and `docs/` - Documentation examples

These are either defaults or documentation and don't affect workflow execution.

## How to Resume Your Workflow

See `HOW_TO_RESUME_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed options.

**Quick recommendation**: 
1. Restart the task from the dashboard
2. The workflow will skip redundant steps since the branch already has commits
3. The QA step will now find the correct `tester-qa` persona âœ…

## What Was Fixed This Session

1. âœ… **DiffApplyStep branch bug** - Diffs now applied to correct feature branch
2. âœ… **QA persona name** - Changed from `qa-engineer` to `tester-qa`

Both issues are now resolved! ðŸŽ‰
